ALERT 05 – 27 
 

SUCTION TANK CONFINED SPACE HAZARD 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
While  in  the  process  of  cleaning  the  rig  mud  pump  suction  tank,  two  employees  had  entered  the  tank  to 
perform  the  task.    A  Work  Permit  had  been  completed  and  a  JSA  pertaining  to  Lock-Out  procedures  had 
been reviewed prior to entry into the tank. However, it had been overlooked that the discharge line from #2 
pump pressure relief valve discharged into this tank compartment.  The #2 pump had not been isolated, nor 
had the pump bleed off line been opened.  Fortunately, the Supervisor observed the danger and removed the 
employees from harm before and incident could occur. 
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
•  The rig specific JSA was not adequate to address all hazards of the task. 
•  All potential hazards had not been identified for this task.   
 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: To address this incident, this company did the following: 
 
•  A complete hazard review of this confined space and related lock-out procedures must be conducted   
•  A revised JSA will be written to address all hazards related to performing work in the mud tanks 
•  The  potential  serious  consequence  of  this  exposure  should  be  discussed  with  crews  in  the  next  HSE 

meeting to raise awareness. 

 
 

The Corrective Actions stated in this alert are one company’s attempts to address the incident,
