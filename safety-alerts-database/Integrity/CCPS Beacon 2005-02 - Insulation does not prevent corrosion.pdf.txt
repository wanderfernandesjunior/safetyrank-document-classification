The legs were fire proofed, hiding corrosion of the structural steel. When the sphere was partially filled with water, it collapsed. One person was killed and one was seriously injured.Insulation Does NOT Prevent CorrosionInsulation Does NOT Prevent CorrosionCorrosion Attacks PipingCorrosion Attacks Structural SupportsHere™s What HappenedUnder insulation corrosion does not discriminate. It attacks process piping, vessels, and structural supports. The photograph on the left shows major external corrosion of a pipe transferring Phenol. The pipe was insulated and failed before the corrosion was discovered. Although no one was injured, it was very expensive to correct the environmental damage and make piping system repairs.Be alert for the signs of hidden corrosion !Be alert for the signs of hidden corrosion !Why This HappenedWhat You Can Do to Detect or Prevent Hidden CorrosionThermal insulation and fire proofing provide the ﬁcoverﬂ for corrosion to hide under and the right environment for it to start and grow in. This cover may trap moisture or spilled chemicals, that under certain circumstances, form corrosive conditions that attack the underlying steel. Because it is hidden from sight, the corrosion often progresses undetected for many years and may result in failure. Know what structures and equipment in your process have the potential for under insulation corrosion.Check low points where moisture might accumulateBe aware of and look for the signs of hidden corrosion:Rust stains or discoloringBulges, blisters or bubbles Small leaks, drips or wisps of vapor or odorsInspectŠlook, but don™t touch. If you disturb a severely corroded area, a leak may occur. Plan inspections and, when necessary, shut down systems before removing corrosion.PSID members see: Free Search--Corrosion
