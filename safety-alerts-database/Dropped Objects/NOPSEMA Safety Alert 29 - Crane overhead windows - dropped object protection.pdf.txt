Crane Overhead Windows Dropped Object Protection

SAFETY ALERT 29

What happened?

During a recent NOPSA inspection of an offshore facility it was noted that the pedestal 
cranes on the facility did not have any grating protection for the overhead windows of the 
crane. Figure 1 shows a crane without drops protection and figure 2 shows a crane with 
drops protection on the overhead window.

 

Figure 1 – no drops protection.

Figure 2 – with drops protection

What could go wrong?

The American Petroleum Institute (API) specification 2C section 12.2 recommends that if 
a crane cab is equipped with an overhead window, a grating or other protection should 
be placed over the window to prevent debris from falling on the operator.

In carrying out a hazard and risk assessment of crane operations, the last line of 
defence or last line escalation factor against dropped objects affecting the crane 
operator is a physical barrier.  Safety glass will not provide the same physical protection 
against dropped objects as a steel grating.

It is recommended that all operators carry out an assessment to confirm crane overhead 
windows are physically protected and not just reliant on safety glass.
