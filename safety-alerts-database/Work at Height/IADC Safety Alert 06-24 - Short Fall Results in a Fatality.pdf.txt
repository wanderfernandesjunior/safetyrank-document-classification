ALERT 06 – 24 
 

SHORT FALL RESULTS IN A FATALITY 

 

WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
Although this incident did not happen in the drilling industry it could easily have been.  A fitter was working on 
a  load-out  support  frame  (LSF)  to  correct  miss-aligned  section  of  the  frame  before  mounting  a  steel  plate.  
He fell from a height of 1.8m while attempting to move towards the ladder attached to the scaffold. He hit the 
left side of his head (behind his left ear) on the corner of a steel working table below the LSF. Shortly before 
the fall, the fitter was positioned with his left foot on the scaffold and the right foot on the LSF. In the process 
of moving towards the ladder, he tripped on an object or slipped and then fell. No eyewitness was present to 
confirm  the  actual  cause  of  the  incident.  The  fitter  sustained  a  fractured skull  (base)  and  laceration,  which 
caused some bleeding, and immediate swelling to the back of the head. He was immediately admitted to the 
hospital and was placed on life support; but he passed away.   
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
•  Primary fall protection devices were not considered for heights below 1.8m.  The company’s risk 

evaluation procedure does not consider heights less than 2.0m a hazard.  

•  The deceased did not recognize the potential hazards associated with his position.  
•  Good housekeeping around the worksite was not enforced.  Hoses were not neatly stowed at the work 

site thereby constituting potential trip hazards.  

JSA was not revised to include hazard of working outside primary fall protection.  
Job and Safety supervision was less than adequate. 

•  Work scope was changed when the deceased needed to work outside the scaffolding.  
• 
• 
 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company instructed the workers in the 
following: 
 
•  Working at elevations should be properly assessed for potential hazard irrespective of the height from 

grade. 
• Always ensure appropriate use of primary fall protection. 
• Always ensure good housekeeping at and around work areas. 
• Always revise risk assessment and/or JSA whenever there is a change in work scope or condition. 
• Always ensure the presence of adequate job and safety supervision at all worksites. Always conduct 
frequent audits to monitor compliance with JSA and housekeeping requirements 

 

The Corrective Actions stated in this alert are one company’s attempts to address the incident,  

and do not necessarily reflect the position of IADC or the IADC HSE Committee.
