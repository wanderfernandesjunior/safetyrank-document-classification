FALL FROM HEIGHT RESULTS IN LTI (RIG MOVE) 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
During a rig move and after the rig floor was raised the Floorman (Injured Person) was standing on the back 
side  of  the  carrier  unit  where  he  was  attempting  to  secure  the  rig  floor  with  chain  and  pin.    When  he 
attempted  to  get  down  he  lost  his  balance  and  fell  about  1  meter  (3  feet)  to  the  ground.    His  body  weight 
shock loaded his left ankle resulting in a fracture of the ankle.  
 

 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
• 
•  Lack of skills for IP as he didn't pay attention while working.

It was the first day in the IP's shift.

meeting.
