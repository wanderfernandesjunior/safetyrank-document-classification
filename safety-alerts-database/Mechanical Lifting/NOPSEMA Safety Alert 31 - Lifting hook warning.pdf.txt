NATIONAL OFFSHORE PETROLEUM SAFETY AUTHORITY 

Lifting Hook Warning 

What happened? 

It has been brought to the attention of NOPSA that there have been hooks in use on 
facilities that are not load bearing on the latches.  When the latch is subject to load 
bearing on the side (picking up tubulars etc.) it is liable to burst open at any time, see 
figures 1 and 2. 

Figure 1 – Hook with latch closed 

 

Figure 2 – Hook with latch open 

 

 

What could go wrong? 

These hooks are basically designed for straight lifts only (crane operations) and should 
only be used in that manner.  Side loading may cause failure at any time resulting in the 
load being dropped. 

Key Lessons: 

It is recommended that all operators check all lifting hooks on board facilities and if they 
have this type of hook ensure procedures are in place so that the hook is never 
subjected to side loading or alternately remove this type of hook from the facility 
altogether.
