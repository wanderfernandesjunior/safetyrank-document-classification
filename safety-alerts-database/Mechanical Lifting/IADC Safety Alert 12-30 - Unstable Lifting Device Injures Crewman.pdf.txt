ALERT 12 – 30  

 

UNSTABLE LIFTING DEVICE INJURES CREWMAN 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
The vessel was about to complete discharging and back loading at the platform. The last lift to come down 
was  an  “I”  shaped  spreader  beam  which  measured  approximately  8  meters  (26  feet)  long.  The  top  and 
bottom of the beam has two lifting eyes situated at each end.  The crane operator lowered and set the beam 
down on the lifting eyes directly against a previously loaded 20 foot (6 meter) basket.  When the tension was 
taken off of the lifting slings, the two Able Seamen (ABs) moved towards the beam to release the slings from 
the hook. As soon as the  slings  were  disconnected,  both  ABs focused their attention on the hook to make 
sure it would not hit them.  At that moment, the ship made a slight rolling movement towards the starboard 
side and the beam flipped over, landing on top of and fracturing the left ankle of one of the AB’s. 
 

 

 

 

WHAT CAUSED IT: 
•  The landing was unstable and the spreader fell on its side due to the beams eyes on the bottom side. 
•  The weather and position of the vessel was calm. The small movements from the vessel attributed to the 

beam standing for approx. 30 seconds in the upright position against the container. 

•  The spreader was not listed on the pre (concept) backload manifest. 
•  The crew was not aware that the spreader beam was to be back loaded beforehand and, therefore, was 

•  This  lifting  beam  was  not  considered  hazardous  cargo  (unstable  cargo)  by  all  personnel  involved  and 

not discussed it in the toolbox meeting. 

accepted to be loaded on the vessel. 

•  The AB’s were both focused on the hook after the cargo was landed, as they considered the beam stable 

and did not move a safe distance away from the beam. 

•  The  injured  AB  was  new  to  the  industry  and  he  was  teamed-up  with  a  colleague  who  worked  for  the 

company for 11 years. 

•  After the beam was unhooked, the injured AB was moving towards instead of away from the cargo. 
 

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company did the following: 
•  The crew was reminded that every lift must be properly planned (Manifest). 
•  All  members  of  the  lifting  team  were  reminded  that  there  must  be  clear  communication  between  the 

deck, bridge and rig. 
It was emphasized to the deck crewmen that more attention should be paid to every lift. 

• 
•  The deck crew was reminded not to unhook any cargo until it is stabilized on deck. 
•  The company took steps to ensure good induction and familiarization for new crew members.
