ALERT 08 – 20 
 

IMPROPER LIFTING PRACTICE (LTI) 

 

WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
While rigging up the V-door during a rig move, the driller was supervising two floormen who were assigned to 
install the V-door pins.  The crane was holding the V-door in an inclined position and lowering it under the 
driller’s signals.  The handrail attached to the V-door steps became stuck against the air hoist on the rig floor 
(driller did not notice it).  The IP was installing the middle pin and another floorman was installing another pin 
beside him, the driller was helping them and giving signal to the crane operator at the same time to lower the 
V-door slightly to facilitate the installation of the pin.  Suddenly the handrail got free from the air hoist and 
moved away fast and the V- door gate support hit the injured person’s (IP’s) left knee.  The IP sustained a 
hematoma in his left knee and put his leg in cast for 2 weeks.  
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
• 

Inadequate supervision and poor communication, as the driller gave a signal to the crane operator to 
lower the V-door in, was not observing the load.   

•  At the same time the IP was still close and installing the pin. 
•  Driller acted as banksman (signal man) and lift supervisor, thus not giving himself full view of the work 

place and he failed to see the handrail hung up on the air winch. 

•  There was a change of design when it was decided to weld the gate support of the V-door.  The 

Management of Change (MOC) process was not followed.  

•  Welding the V-door gate allowed the hand rail to get tangled with the air hoist on the rig floor.  
•  The Safe Job Assessment (SJA) did not address the potential of the load getting hung up on the air 

winch. 

Improve lifting competency of the crew and supervisors. 

 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company did the following: 
 
•  Proper SJA to be issued and communicated with rig crews in the pre-job meeting. 
•
