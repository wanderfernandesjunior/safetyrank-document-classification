ALERT 08 – 02 
 

STANDPIPE PRESSURE GAUGE THREAD NIPPLE 

FAILURE (UNDER PRESSURE) 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
The rig crew was reaming back to bottom after making a connection.  The hole fill was encountered before 
the kelly bushings reached the table, so the driller rotated the string with the kelly spinner to clean out the fill.  
While  lining  up  the  table  and  kelly  bushings,  the  mud  pump  pressure  spiked  and  simultaneously  the  mud 
pump “pop-off” (pressure relief) valve blew.  At the same instant the stand pipe pressure gauge blew out of 
the  standpipe.    The  pressure  gauge  glanced  off  the  “A-leg”  and  struck  a  worker  who  was  cleaning  the 
breakout tong dies.  The worker received a laceration to the head, three broken ribs, a fractured shoulder, 
and a collapsed lung.  
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
The  investigation  determined  that  the  two  inch  nipple  had  only  three  threads  buried  (threaded)  into  the 
standpipe receptacle. 
 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company instructed rig personnel the 
following: 
 
1.  Rig supervisors are to review this incident with all crewmembers.   
2.  Rig supervisors are to ensure crewmembers know how to properly install a high pressure nipple and / or 

attachments (i.e., gauge, nipple, blow-plug, “T-junction’s”, etc.).  

3.  When installing or repairing a high pressure line and /or attachments, this task must be supervised by the 

4. 

Rig Manager or Driller to ensure proper nipple selection and installation.  
Inspect  all  high  pressure  lines and  fittings  to  ensure the  correct  amount  of  threads have  been  “buried” 
(threaded) into the receiving receptacle.  

5.  A new standard for high pressure lines and fittings will be implemented at a later date within company.
