Safety Alert 

        From the International Association of Drilling Contractors 

 
ALERT 07 – 39 
 

WIRE ROPE PARTED RESULTS IN A  

HIGH POTENTIAL NEAR MISS 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
While racking back a stand of 6-1/2" drill collars, the winch line used at the monkey board to rack the drill 
collars parted.  This allowed the collar to swing into the back of the derrick and in the process struck the rig 
tong cable sheave bracket.  After the Driller began lowering the blocks the bracket itself dropped to the rig 
floor from approximately 20 meters (66 feet).  The vibration from the derrick aided in breaking the remainder 
of the bracket weld off.  No one was aware of this until the bracket actually fell.  No personnel were injured.  
The bracket fell approximately 2 meters (6.6 feet) from one a floormen. 
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
•  The Derrickman needs to remain alert while watching the winch line.  
•  Winch line was in bad condition.   
•  OEM welds on the sheave bracket were of poor quality.   
•  No safety lines were installed on the sheave.   
•  There  was  no  proper  way  of  rigging  up  safety  lines  on  sheaves,  ie,  no  pad  eyes  or  holes  to  place  a 

safety sling through at the time. 

 

 

 

 
 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company did the following: 
 
•  Repairs to the bracket will be made as soon as possible depending on the rig operating schedule.   
•  Safety sling on Driller’s side bracket installed temporarily until pad eyes or holes can be completed. 
•  Weld a pad eye on each sheave bracket to allow for proper rigging up of a safety sling, or drill holes in 

the brackets to accommodate a safety sling. 

•  Engineering (modification) requests are to be submitted for any alterations to be completed on sheave 

brackets to install safety cables. 

•  Crew must keep Job Safety Analysis (JSAs) current.  
•  Crew Safety Meetings will be scheduled to review serious incidents such as this.
