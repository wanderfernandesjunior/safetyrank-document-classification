               Alert 3-07 

SECURING OF WATERTIGHT DOORS WHILE UNDERWAY 

 
This safety alert reiterates the need for vessel operators to ensure that watertight doors are always 
closed  while  underway,  except  when  being  used  for  access.    This  alert  is  the  direct  result  of  a 
collision between a 534’ cargo ship and a 166’ offshore supply vessel.  The incident occurred on the 
Mississippi  River,  in  a  restricted  visibility  situation.    As  a  result  of  the  collision,  the  offshore  supply 
vessel capsized and sank – the crew of five was lost. 
 
During the ensuing investigation of this incident, evidence was uncovered that indicated the offshore 
supply  vessel  was  operating  with  its  watertight  doors  in  the  open  position.    This  is  a  violation  of  46 
CFR  174.210(e),  which  states  that  the  master  must  ensure  that  a  watertight  door  is  always  closed, 
except when being used for access.  Watertight doors are a critical part of a vessel’s subdivision, and 
consequently  a  critical  part  of  damage  stability  considerations,  so  the  importance  of  keeping  these 
closed is very obvious.  This becomes even more critical on smaller ships, which may only have one 
or two watertight doors to prevent flooding the entire length of the ship. 
 
Please, keep these doors closed! 
 
The  Office  of  Design  and  Engineering  Standards,  Naval  Architecture  Division  (CG-3PSE-2) 
developed  this  alert.    Questions  pertaining  to  this  safety  alert  may  be  addressed  to  LCDR  Tracy 
Phillips at (202) 372-1373 or Tracy.Phillips@uscg.mil.
