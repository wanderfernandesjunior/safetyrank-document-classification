INATTENTION RESULTS IN DAMAGED MONKEYBOARD 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
While pulling a stand of drill pipe from the mouse-hole the top drive hit the monkey board causing damage to 
the board and the top drive.  The crew had just made up a stand of drill pipe in the mouse-hole and was 
pulling the stand up to make a connection.  However, during this operation, the driller forgot to retract the top 
drive and while the stand was being lifted into place, the elevators/bails crashed into the monkey board.   
 

The driller forgot to retract the top drive prior to making the connection. 
Lack of experience, the driller had only been drilling a week prior to this incident.  
Complacency, routine jobs require the same amount of attention as special operations. 

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company did the following: 
 
• 

Instructed company drillers to always pay attention to the steps of the procedure for every task, no 
matter how routine or minor it may seem. 
Reminded rig supervisors that experience is a valuable asset.  The driller will continue to get more 
experience and he will gain confidence with every connection. 
Instructed drillers and other rig personnel not to let over-confidence make the situation complacent.  
Routine jobs no matter how minor shall always require 100% attention. 

The Corrective Actions stated in this alert are one company’s attempts to address the incident,  

and do not necessarily reflect the position of IADC or the IADC HSE Committee.
