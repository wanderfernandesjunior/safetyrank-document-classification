Injuries Caused by Boat Landing Collapse  

After Personnel Rope Transfer  

 
 

 

 

On February 14, 2019, a production contractor was conducting a pollution inspection on a 
Gulf of Mexico platform. The individual successfully transferred from the boat to the platform 
via rope transfer, landing on the grating of the boat landing. Upon completion of the transfer, 
the grating gave way and the individual fell into the water.  
 
The  boat  deckhands  immediately  retrieved  the  individual  from  the  water.  The  individual 
sustained cuts to his legs and other undefined injuries to his knee and back. The individual 
was transported to shore for additional medical treatment.   
  
 
Therefore, BSEE recommends that operators consider the following: 
 

•  Develop and ensure implementation of a Safe Boarding Plan for any facility that may 

present hazards to normal boarding processes. 

•  Prior to boarding, use flyovers or close approach by boat to establish the general 

condition of the structure and determine if the structure has obvious damage. 

•  Conduct a general visual inspection of the above-water structure to identify 

additional safety concerns and possible structural damage to determine if a below-
water inspection is required.   

•  Review this Safety Alert with all personnel who transfer to facilities via swing rope 
or personnel baskets to make sure employees are aware of all potential hazards 
associated with personnel transfers.
