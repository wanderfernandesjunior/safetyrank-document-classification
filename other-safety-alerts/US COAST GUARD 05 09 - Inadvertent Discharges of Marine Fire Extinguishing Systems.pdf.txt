INADVERTENT DISCHARGES OF MARINE FIRE EXTINGUISHING SYSTEMS 

 
 
This Safety Alert addresses a critical problem involving ANSUL - High Pressure Carbon Dioxide fire 
extinguishing  systems  (Coast  Guard  Approval  number  162.038/7).  The  Coast  Guard  has  become 
aware  of  several  instances  where  this  particular  fire  extinguishing  system  has  discharged  without 
human intentional or accidental involvement.  
 
The system manufacturer, ANSUL has identified the suspect CO2 cylinder valves as those having a 
date code between 10-07 and 06-08.  This date code is located on a flat surface immediately above 
the  threaded  section  which  enters  the  cylinder  and  opposite  the  discharge  outlet.  See  the  attached 
ANSUL bulletin for important details. 
 
The  Coast  Guard  strongly  recommends  that  owners  and  operators  who  have  ANSUL  High 
Pressure  Carbon  Dioxide  Systems  onboard  their  vessels  and  others  who  may  own,  sell  or  service 
these systems carefully follow the instructions on the attached ANSUL Bulletin.
