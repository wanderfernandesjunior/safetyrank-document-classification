Safety Alert 

From the International Association of Drilling Contractors

 

 
ALERT 02 – 24  
 

TUBING TRANSFER RESULTS IN NEAR MISS 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
A  crane  was  being  used  to  transfer  3  joints  of  2  7/8”  tubing form one side of the rig to the other side.  The 
individual  doing  the  rigging  left  his  hand  between  the  load  and  the  lifting  sling  that  was  wrapped  around  the 
joints of tubing.  When the crane lifted the load, and the injured person still had his hand between the load and 
the sling, his fingers were squeezed between slings and joints of tubing. 
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
1.  No pre-job safety meeting was held. 
2.  From the report we presume that there was no assigned person to give signal to crane operator. 
3.  Lack of communication between crane operator and IP. 
4.  Lack of alertness by the workers. 
 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company did the following:   
 
1.  Pre-job  safety  meeting  to  be  conducted  with  all  crew  members  involved  in  the  task  and  shall  be 

documented. 

2.  Communication to be agreed upon. 
3.  Tag line to be used for all lifts. 
4.  Crane operator to ensure all personnel are clear from load before beginning to lift. 
5.  Supervisor shall exercise total observation techniques during the job. 
 
 

The Corrective Actions stated in this alert are one company’s attempts to address the incident, and do not 

necessarily reflect the position of IADC or the IADC HSE Committee.
