ALERT 11 – 27  
 

LACK OF PROPER TOOL RESULTS IN FINGER INJURY 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
Recently, on-board an installation, a member of the maintenance crew suffered a finger injury while manually 
removing  a  section  of  steel  grating  in  the  Engine  Room.    The  section  of  grating  measured  3ft  x  3ft  and 
weighed approximately 46kg (~100lbs).   
 

Position of IP’s 
fingers at the 
time of incident 

 

 

 

 

WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
While sliding the grating to attain access, the crew member trapped his finger between the section of 
grating he was moving and the deck grating underneath. 
 
The  investigation  revealed  that  the  practice  of  sliding  the  grating,  for  access  purposes,  had  become 
common practice onboard this installation. 
 

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company did the following: 
 
  Recommended that grating pullers (pictured below) be purchased or built following engineered design.  
The grating pullers are designed to provide a hands free approach to removing sections of grating, which 
will minimize the possibility of trapping or crushing fingers in-between grating sections. 

The Corrective Actions stated in this alert are one company’s attempts to address the incident,  

and do not necessarily reflect the position of IADC or the IADC HSE Committee.

        From the International Association of Drilling Contractors 

 

 

Instructed maintenance personnel that during grating removal the following must be considered: 

o  Does it infringe on walkways?  
o  Will it require more than one person to lift?  
o  Could the section of grating be modified to make the task easier? 
o  Will the removal of the grating result in a fall hazard (barriers required)

Safety Alert 

        From the International Association of Drilling Contractors 

Instructed  Offshore  Installation  Managers  (OIMs)  to  ensure  that  either  the  correct  tool  is  available 
onboard their installation or that other suitable means (e.g. mechanical lifting devices, handles, etc.) are 
employed, which will protect fingers, when the grating is being removed. 
 
Instructed maintenance personnel that the grating lifting tool should be utilized in areas where it is not 
practical to use mechanical lifting devices or other suitable means.  If mechanical lifting devices or other 
suitable means are available, and the risk assessment has identified these as the most suitable option, 
then these can be used.
