 Check the Clearance Many plants are required to perform on-line maintenance or construction using large scale tools and equipment (cranes, hoists, bundle pullers, welding machines, vacuum trucks). The transport and operation of such equipment onto operating plant sites can pose a significant risk and result in accidents unless steps are taken to make sure that process facilities are secure. Process Safety Beacon CCPS An AIChE Industry Technology Alliance Sponsored by AIChE Following are some key safety considerations: Check that adequate space is allocated when moving construction equipment onto a plant site. Check clearances on overhead power lines, instrument conduits and pipe racks. Pre-plan all turns and ensure that construction equipment does not strike people, process equipment, or areas where workers gather. Take large mobile equipment apart into smaller components when possible before transit. Never travel with the jib assembled on a tall crane. Always travel at a slow speed and have a groundsman or signalman walk ahead of the load. Pay particular attention to the wind effects on moving suspended loads and take all the necessary precautions. Remember that long loads are highly susceptible to grade changes or ground conditions. A slight dip or rise in the road of a few inches may cause a boom to swing several feet. Make sure that equipment is securely positioned before use and that it will not strike people, equipment or buildings. AIChE Â© 2003. All rights reserved.
