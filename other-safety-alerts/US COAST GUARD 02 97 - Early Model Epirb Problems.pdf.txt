EARLY MODEL ACR/RLB-23, 406 Mhz EPIRB PROBLEMS 

      Safety Alert 02-97 
 

THIS  ALERT  APPLIES  ONLY  TO  EARLY  MODEL  ACR/RLB-23,  406  Mhz  EPIRB'S  THAT  HAVE 
MAGNETICALLY ACTIVATED INTERNAL SWITCHES AND NOT THE NEWER MODEL ACR/RLB-23, 406 
MHZ  EPRIBS  THAT  HAVE  SALT  WATER  ACTIVATION  SWITCHES.  Information  provided  courtesy  of 
Marine Safety Office San Francisco.  

During the investigations into the events surrounding the recent loss of a commercial fishing vessel, it was 
found  that  the  vessel's  EPIRB  successfully  deployed  from  its  hydrostatic  release  mount.  However,  the 
EPIRB's  signal  was  never  received  by  the  search  and  rescue  coordinators.  It  is  believed  that  the  EPIRB 
failed to transmit a signal because the power switch on the EPIRB itself was not turned to the required "ON-
TEST" position when it was mounted in its storage bracket. 

The investigation found that the vessel's ACR/RLB-23 EPIRB had been serviced by the manufacturer and 
returned to the owner just two weeks prior to the casualty. These EPIRB units are serviced and tested by 
the manufacturer and then shipped from the servicing facility ready to be used. Typically, the manufacturer 
places a narrow yellow tape labeled "DO NOT REMOVE BEFORE USE" over the "ON-TEST/OFF" switch 
found  on  the  top  of  the  EPIRB.  This  tape  MUST  be  removed  before  the  EPIRB  is  placed  in  its  mounting 
bracket.  

OWNERS  AND  USERS  OF  EARLY  MODEL  ACR/RLB-23,  406  Mhz  EPIRBs  THAT  HAVE 
MAGNETICALLY  ACTIVATED  INTERNAL  SWITCHES  ARE  CAUTIONED  THAT  FAILURE  TO  MOUNT 
THE  EPIRB  CORRECTLY  CAN  LEAD  TO  A  FALSE  SENSE  OF  PROTECTION.  THE  EPIRB  WILL  NOT 
TRANSMIT  A  DISTRESS  SIGNAL  IF  IT  IS  AUTOMATICALLY  RELEASED  UNLESS  IT  IS  MOUNTED  IN 
THE FOLLOWING MANNER: 

1.  Remove the narrow yellow tape labeled "DO NOT REMOVE BEFORE USE" which is affixed by the 

manufacturer over the "ON-TEST/OFF" switch on top of the EPIRB.  

2.  Place  the  "ARM/ON"  switch  found  on  the  bottom  of  the  mounting  bracket  to  the  "ARM"  position. 

Make sure that the slide switch actually snaps into its indent. 

3.  Place  the  EPIRB  into  the  foam  cradles  on  the  bottom  of  the  mounting  bracket.  This  should  be 
accomplished by aligning the strobe light and switch guard at the top of the unit with the proper cut-
outs on the foam locator of the mount. 

4.  Place  the  "ON-TEST/OFF"  switch,  located  on  the  top  of  the  EPIRB,  to  the  "ON-TEST"  position. 
Although this will actually turn the EPIRB on, the unit will turn off once it is correctly mounted it the 
bracket. The EPIRB's switch must always be in the "ON-TEST" position while it is in the mounting 
bracket. 

5.  Move the "ARM/ON" switch on the mounting bracket to the "ON" position ensuring that it snaps into 

the indent. The EPIRB will now activate and the strobe light will begin flashing within 15 seconds.

the 

"ARM"  position.  
This should be done within 45 seconds of placing the "ARM/ON" switch on the mounting bracket to 
the "ON" position in step #5.

PLEASE  NOTE  THAT  THE  FAILURE  TO  MOVE  THE  "ARM/ON"  SWITCH  ON  THE  MOUNTING 
BRACKET  TO  THE  "ARM"  POSITION  WITHIN  45  SECONDS  WILL  CAUSE  THE  EPIRB  TO 
TRANSMIT A DISTRESS SIGNAL.  

7.  Secure mounting cover over EPIRB. 

8.  The  strobe  will  now  shut  off  but  the  EPIRB  will  be  armed  and  ready  for  automatic  release  in  the 

event of a casualty.
