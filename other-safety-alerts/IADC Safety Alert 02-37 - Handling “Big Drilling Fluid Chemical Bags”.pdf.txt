Safety Alert 

From the International Association of Drilling Contractors

 

 
ALERT 02 – 37  
 

HANDLING “BIG DRILLING FLUID CHEMICAL BAGS” 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
We continue to see the manual handling of big bags for materials on our rigs.  This is a reminder of the fatality 
that occurred last year using big bags.   
 
WHAT CAUSED IT:  
 
The big bags are very unstable. 
 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company did the following:   
 
A resting cradle or seat capable of 
handling the weight of the bags being 
used on each rig was designed by the 
company engineering department.   
 
This cradle must be placed over the 
mixing hopper on all rigs so that the bags 
will be caught by the cradle if the bag 
does fall.  
 
At no time are employees to be within 2 
meters horizontally of any Big Bags while 
they are being lifted. 
 
Only when the bag is in the protection of 
the hopper cradle can an employee 
approach to open bag. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IADC Note:  This is a follow up to alert 
01 – 32. 

 

The Corrective Actions stated in this alert are one company’s attempts to address the incident, and do not
