WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
The deck crew were in the process of placing a joint of high pressure slick line riser into a cargo basket. The 
cargo basket already had two riser joints in the bottom of the basket. After resting the riser into the container, the 
injured person (IP) and another crewmember entered the cargo basket to remove the slings. When the IP had 
finished removing his side of the slings, one of the bottom risers started to roll which caused the top riser to push 
against the other two below. The IP’s foot was between the two risers that were already in the cargo basket 
before they shifted. The IP sustained a fracture resulting in a recordable incident. 
 

LESSONS LEARNED: 
 

•  There is always the potential for a load to shift position; tubulars are known to shift position and roll.  
•  Personnel should avoid entering a basket or climbing on equipment, which can cause a load to shift.  
•  Entering baskets should be a last resort and entering should be risk assessed for the potential of a shifted 

load.
