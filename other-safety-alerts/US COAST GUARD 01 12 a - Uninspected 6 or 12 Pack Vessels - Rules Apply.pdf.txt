Uninspected 6 or 12 pack Vessels – Rules Apply 

 

Know Them! 

 
The  Coast  Guard's  Office  of  Auxiliary  and  Boating  Safety  has  become  aware  of  instances  where 
recreational  type  boats  are  being  manufactured  and  sold  but  do  not  meet  federal  construction 
requirements.    In  some  cases  persons  holding  Uninspected  Passenger  Vessel  (UPV)  Operator 
licenses  are  operating  such  vessels  while  carrying  passengers  for  hire.    This  alert  reminds  UPV 
operators both six-pack and twelve pack, to ensure that they are aware that all vessels operated as 
UPVs are in compliance with the appropriate U.S. laws and regulations. 
 
The laws applicable to UPVs are found at 46 USC 4105(a); recreational vessels are addressed in 46 
USC Chapter 43.  The regulations based on those laws are found in 33 CFR Parts 181 and 183 and 
are the minimum safety standards for recreational boat manufacturing and include the requirements 
for:  
 

identification of boats 

•  certification 
• 
•  display of capacity information 
•  safe loading 
•  safe powering 
• 
•  electrical systems 
• 
•  ventilation requirements 
•  start-in-gear protection 
•  navigation lights 

fuel systems 

flotation requirements (for both inboard and outboard powered boats (including airboats)) 

 
It is the responsibility of U.S. Coast Guard licensed Masters that operate UPVs in passenger-for-hire 
operations to ensure compliance with all federal requirements applicable to the vessel.

Investigator,  (202) 372-1052 or michael.a.jendrossek@uscg.mil. Developed by the Office of Auxiliary
