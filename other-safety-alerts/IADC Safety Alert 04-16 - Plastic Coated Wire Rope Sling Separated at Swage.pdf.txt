From the International Association of Drilling Contractors 

 

 
ALERT 04 – 16 
 

PLASTIC COATED WIRE ROPE SLING SEPARATED AT SWAGE 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
While  positioning  the  stack  test  cap,  the  attached  sling  separated  at  the  swage.  The  eye  of  the  sling  was 
coated with plastic and crimped into the swage.  This sling had been included in a lifting survey completed in 
June 2003. The sling was rated for 5 tons and parted at 2 tons.  Due to the load being controlled, rather than a 
free load, the cap was unable to fall any distance and no injuries were sustained. 
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
•  Eye of sling was coated with plastic including the area crimped into the swage.  
•  The plastic coating increases moisture and accelerates corrosion.  
•  The plastic coating inhibits the visual inspection for corrosion. 
•  Plastic coating inhibits proper gripping of the cable by the swage  
 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company did the following: 
 
Instructed personnel to remove from service any plastic coated wire slings where inspection indicates that 
plastic coating is included in the crimped area of the swage.   
 

 
 
IADC Note:  Sling manufacturers recommend that all plastic coating be removed from under the swage before 
it is crimped.  Plastic coating decreases the coefficient of friction required for making a swaged sling.   

 

The Corrective Actions stated in this alert are one company’s attempts to address the incident, and do not 

necessarily reflect the position of IADC or the IADC HSE Committee.
