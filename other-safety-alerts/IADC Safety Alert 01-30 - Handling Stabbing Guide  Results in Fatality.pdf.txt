Handling Stabbing Guide Results in Fatality 

WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
While installing a stabbing guide on the box of 5 ½” sand screen tubing in the rotary slips, an assistant 
derrickman was fatally injured when caught between the stabbing guide on top of the tubing and the bell 
guide below the pipe handler on the top drive. 
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 

•  The installation of the stabbing guide was conducted when the top drive was in close proximity to the 

tubing above the rotary slips and was subject to be lowered to allow the elevators to be latched on 
the joint in the mousehole. 

•  While attempting to latch the elevators on a joint of sand screen in the mousehole, the person 
operating the drawworks controls and the top drive link tilt, lost control of the traveling blocks 
resulting in an uncontrolled descent of the traveling equipment. 

 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company did the following: 
 

•  Verify that all personnel required to operate the driller’s controls have sufficient experience and skill 

to safely conduct all operations undertaken. 

 

 

•  Write Written Work Instructions for all operations in sufficient detail to identify the proper sequence of 

safety critical tasks. 

The Corrective Actions stated in this alert are one company’s attempts to address the incident,
