Life Jacket Snap Hooks 

 

The  U.S.  Coast  Guard  Sector  Central  Pacific  has  recently  discovered  defective  snap  hooks  with 
corroded  spring  clips  installed  on  four  models  of  U.S.  Coast  Guard  Approved  Lifejackets,  Type  I 
personal flotation devices manufactured by Cal-June Inc., a.k.a. Jim Buoy. The snap hook assembly 
is  the  key  component  used  to  ensure  primary  closure  for  these  lifejackets.  The  spring  clip  is  a 
component  of  the  snap  hook  assembly  and  the  mechanism  that  keeps  the  hook  from  disengaging 
once connected to the D-ring of the lifejacket’s chest strap.  
 
Improper materials were used during the manufacturing process. Consequently, due to the corrosive 
nature of marine environments it is only a matter of time until these defective snap hooks deteriorate 
and fail to operate as designed.  
 
The  image  below  illustrates  a  defective  hook  and  the  remains  of  a  corroded  spring  clip.  This  snap 
hook is reported to have been in service for less than one year.  

Cal-June  Inc.  has  acknowledged  that  the  snap  hook  springs  are  defective  and  is  committed  to 
replacing  all  defective  snap  hooks  with  new  snap  hook  assemblies  at  no  cost  to  lifejacket  owners. 
They  have  determined  that  the  defective  snap  hooks  were  only  used  on  lifejackets  having  lot 
numbers  identified  in  the  table  below.  A  total  of  5,371  lifejackets  were  manufactured  with  the 
defective snap hooks and sold between October 1, 2002 and March 15, 2004.

The Coast Guard strongly recommends that owners and operators of vessels having Type I PFDs 
with metallic snap hooks inspect the snap hook assemblies carefully.  

•  The  entire  snap  hook  including  the  clip  should  be  made  of  non-magnetic  materials  such  as 
bronze or stainless steel. Defective hooks will have spring clips that may be identified by signs 
of  corrosion.  A  magnet  may  also  be  used  to  identify  improper  material.  Simply  touch  the 
magnet  to  the  surface  of  the  spring  clip.  If  the  magnet  is  attracted  to  or  attaches  to  the  clip, 
then the snap hook assembly must be replaced.  

•  Contact  Cal-June  immediately  to  obtain  replacements  for  spring  clips  that  are  corroded  or 

determined to be magnetic.  

If similar problems are identified with other life jackets not manufactured by Cal-June, or if you have 
questions regarding this safety alert, contact Mr. Daniel McCormick of the Lifesaving and Fire Safety 
Standards Division at dmccormick@comdt.uscg.mil or 202.267.2713.  

General questions regarding this safety alert or its delivery may be addressed to Mr. Ken Olsen of the 
Office of Investigations and Analysis at kolsen@comdt.uscg.mil or 202.267.1417.
