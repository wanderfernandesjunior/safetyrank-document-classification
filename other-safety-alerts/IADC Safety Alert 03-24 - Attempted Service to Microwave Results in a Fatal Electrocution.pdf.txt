Safety Alert 

From the International Association of Drilling Contractors 

 

 
ALERT 03 – 24 
 

ATTEMPTED SERVICE TO MICROWAVE RESULTS IN  

FATAL ELECTROCUTION 

 
WHAT HAPPENED:   
 
An  experienced  electrician  (12  years  with  the  company)  opened  up  the  microwave  in  spite  of  dire 
warnings  not  to  do  so.    A  warning  label,  clearly  indicated  the  potential  for  high  voltage,  was 
prominently displayed on the machine.  He put a tester across the disconnected leads with the power 
on (several thousand volts); the current went to ground through his body, via the ice-making machine 
next to where he was working - burn marks confirm this.   The incident resulted in a fatality.  
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
The electrician did not heed the warning on the cover of the device and removed the safety cover.
