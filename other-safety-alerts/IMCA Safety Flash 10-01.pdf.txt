Divex  would  advise  all  users  to  check  their  extinguishers  to  ensure  dip  tubes  are  fitted  correctly 
and not damaged.   

ANY FIRE EXTINGUISHER THAT HAS A MISSING/BROKEN DIP TUBE WILL NOT OPERATE 
CORRECTLY AND WILL THEREFORE NOT FULFIL ITS FUNCTION IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION. 

 
Damaged/missing dip tubes are available as spared items in lengths to suit the 7.5 litre & 3 litre Hyfex units. 
 
FAULT IDENTIFICATION METHOD: 
 

a)  For uncharged/out of service units: 

-  Ensure unit is de-pressurised in accordance with the manual. 
-  Remove handle/valve assembly and ensure Dip tube is fitted to lower valve assembly body and is not 
damaged anywhere along its length. Ensure the dip tube is correctly sized to almost touch the bottom 
of cylinder. 

-  The Serial numbers of any Hyfex’s with missing/damaged dip tube units must be advised to Divex in 

writing together with date of purchase information if known. 

 
      b)  For in-service charged units: 

To avoid wasting a water/AFFF foam solution charge:   
- 
- 

Prepare Hyfex for operation by removing safety pin, etc. 
Invert the cylinder and, whilst ensuring the hose is pointing in a safe direction, inverting will place the 
charge  gas  around  the  dip  tube  end  zone  and  all  the  liquid  at  valve  end.  Operate  the  valve  handle 
slowly, opening the valve only a small amount.  
If after 2-5 seconds you find only gas coming from the hose/nozzle assembly then this indicates that 
the dip tube is present and working correctly. 

- 

-  You may continue to drain off all gas pressure if you wish, then (with unit in normal upright position) 

remove handle/valve/dip tube assembly for inspection as per manual instructions. 

After re-assembly (if disassembled) the unit should be recharged/topped up by the normal method using 
appropriate gas mixture. 

 

 

Caution:  If  during  this  inverted  test  only  water/foam  solution  comes  from  hose/nozzle  whilst  in  the 
inverted position, this indicates the DIP TUBE is MISSING/DAMAGED. 
These units must be depressurised completely, then dissembled by removing the Handle/valve/dip tube 
assembly as per the manual instructions. 
Damaged/Missing dip tubes require to be replaced. 
Serial numbers of all Hyfex with missing/damaged dip tubes must be advised to Divex.
