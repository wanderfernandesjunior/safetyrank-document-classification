Inspection and maintenance of lifeboats 

 
 
What happened? 
Recent events on Norwegian facilities have highlighted the need for appropriate 
design  and  manufacturing  regimes,  coupled  with  robust 
inspection,  and 
maintenance processes for lifeboats.  Two unrelated events have occurred: 

•  Possible  design  and  manufacturing  deviations  have  been  identified  in  a 

certain type of freefall lifeboat, and; 

• 

Inspections  of  some  conventional  twin  fall  davit  launched  lifeboats  have 
revealed structural integrity issues in the load paths of several boats. 

 
Both occurrences were identified as serious issues, and led to total shutdown of 
production,  and  partial  de-manning  of  the  platform(s)  involved.    Whilst  the 
number of freefall boats on Australian offshore facilities is limited, the availability 
of a lifeboat, be it freefall, or single or twin fall davit launched, must be ensured.  
The  boat’s  structural  integrity  must  be  maintained,  and  the  performance 
standards  identified  in  the  safety  case  for  these  essential  safety  critical  items 
must be complied with. 
 
What went wrong? 
In the freefall boat event, cracks were noted in the canopy and superstructure of 
the  freefall  boats(s)  after  a  routine  launch.    This  led  to  questions  of  structural 
integrity of the boats, which were withdrawn from service, pending investigations 
by operator and vendor. 

In  the  davit  launched  boat  event,  testing  of  the  boats  revealed  defects  in  the 
lowering  arrangements  of  the  boats.  Further  investigations  also  revealed 
corrosion  of  components  in  the  load  path,  resulting  in  structural  integrity 
questions.    These  boats  were  also  withdrawn  from  service,  pending  an 
investigation.  This investigation has not yet been completed.

Key Lessons 
Initial validation of the design and manufacture of key safety critical equipment is 
an important factor in ensuring availability of such equipment. 
 
The  ongoing  availability  of  such  equipment  must  be  ensured  by  robust 
inspection,  testing  and  maintenance  regimes.    Where  there  is  a  possibility  of 
‘latent’  faults  remaining  undiscovered,  (for  example  corrosion  on  key  structural 
components), due perhaps to inaccessibility to the components, then the regime 
must  take  account  of  this.    More  invasive  techniques,  or  more  frequent 
inspections, may be required to allow continued assurance of availability.

regimes in forthcoming offshore visits to facilities.
