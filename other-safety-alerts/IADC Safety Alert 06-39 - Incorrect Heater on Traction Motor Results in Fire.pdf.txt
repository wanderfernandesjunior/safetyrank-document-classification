ALERT 06 – 39  
 

INCORRECT HEATER ON TRACTION MOTOR RESULTS IN FIRE 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
Gas from the well bore collected under the rig floor and ignited. 
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
Investigation  determined  that  the  gas  also  filled  the  rotary  drive  traction  motor  which  was  equipped  with  a 
general purpose space heater.  General purpose space heaters are not designed to maintain temperatures 
below flash points.  The space heater provided the source of ignition. 
 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company did the following: 
 
Ensure that all rotary drive and drawworks traction motors are equipped with EXP heaters.  If they are not, 
immediately  remove  power  from  the  heaters  and  order  replacement  heaters.    Each  rig  will  be  required  to 
verify completion of inspection.  All inspections and material requisitions should be completed and faxed to 
the Corporate Maintenance Department.
