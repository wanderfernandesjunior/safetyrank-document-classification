ALERT 08 – 05 
 

FALL FROM SCAFFOLDING RESULTS IN EMPLOYEE INJURY 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
Two employees were attempting to install a mud bucket drain hose from the flow line to underneath the rig 
floor.  Standing on the BOP scaffolding which had been installed prior to their shift, the two men found the 
hose connection to be just out of reach.  Both men attached their lanyards onto scaffolding handrails.  One 
man was attached to the handrail on the back piece of scaffolding and the other man to the handrail on the 
side piece of scaffolding.  The men then climbed up onto the handrail on the side piece of scaffolding and 
reached out to couple the hose.  Without warning, the side piece of scaffolding flipped, and fell to the ground.  
The  employee  whose  lanyard  was  attached  to  the  handrail  on  this  piece  of  scaffolding  was  pulled 
approximately 15’ to the ground with the scaffolding (See pictures below).  The employee suffered a severe 
laceration to his head, fractured vertebrae in his back and neck as well as three broken ribs.  The other man 
grabbed  nearby  air  lines  to  prevent  himself  falling.    He  then  pulled  himself  back  onto  the  remaining 
scaffolding avoiding injury. 
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
1.  The employees did not utilize any of the three safety retracting lifeline blocks mounted within arms reach 

2.  The two men did not tie-off to a secure anchor point.  The employees had a false sense of security when 

in the substructure. (See pictures below.)  

they attached their lanyards to handrails. 

3.  Both employees climbed the handrails to access the work area.   
4.  The scaffolding is equipped with chain hoists at each corner to properly position the work platform.  The 
employees did not take the time to raise the platform which would have enabled them to perform the job 
safely.   

5.  The scaffolding assembly was put together but not 100% assembled.  The side scaffolding was not 

bolted to the front and rear scaffolding to secure it as designed.   

6.  A pre-job meeting was not conducted prior to starting the job.  As such the potential hazards were not 

identified or addressed.   

7.  The mud bucket drain hose was not installed prior to raising the rig floor.   
8.  The bolt holes for securing the scaffolding are difficult to line up.  Additionally, the location of the bolt 
holes/bolts makes it difficult to visually observe and ensure the assembly is secure.  Bolt threads are 
easily damaged due to mud, dirt and corrosion. 

 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company did the following: 
 
1.  These  devices  are  installed  and  available  to  protect  our  employees  and  prevent  injuries.    Safety 

retracting lifeline blocks are to be utilized when conducting this type of work.  

2.  Handrails are NOT secure anchor points.   
3.  Handrails are NOT ladders and should NEVER be climbed. 
4.  Crews must take the time needed to ensure work is completed in a safe manner. 
5.  When  installing  any  equipment  such  as  scaffolding,  be  sure  the installation  is  complete  before  moving 

onto the next job. 

6.  Pre-job meetings MUST be conducted prior to non-routine jobs such as this to make sure: 1) all hazards 

are identified and addressed; 2) proper instruction is provided and; 3) the job is not rushed. 

7.  Assemble ALL possible hoses and lines prior to raising the rig floor. 
8.  The securing mechanism is being redesigned to simplify securing the scaffolding together to insure the 
walkways are secure and provide employees a more visible means for ensuring it is secured. Pins with 
keepers should be considered instead of bolts as it’s easier to drive a pin with a hammer.
