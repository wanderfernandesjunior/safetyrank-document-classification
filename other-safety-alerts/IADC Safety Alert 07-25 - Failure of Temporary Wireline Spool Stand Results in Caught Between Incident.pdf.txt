ALERT 07 – 25 
 

FAILURE OF TEMPORARY WIRELINE SPOOL STAND  

RESULTS IN CAUGHT BETWEEN INCIDENT 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
While installing a ¾” cable from the shipping spool to the derrick gin pole, the pipe being used in the spooling 
rack to support the cable spool (axle) slipped off the rack causing the spool to fall to the deck.  This caused 
the spool of cable to drop to one side of the spool rack catching the employee’s finger between the pad eye 
on the pipe and the spool rack.  This resulted in a partial amputation of the left little finger. 
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
•  The hazard was not identified in the JSA. 
•  The pipe (Axle) was not secured to keep it from sliding out of the spool rack. 
•  The employee did not notice that the pipe was sliding out because he was watching another aspect of 

the job. 

 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company instructed rig personnel to:    
 
Update all JSAs involving installation of wire rope to: 
 
•  Require a positive lockdown device to hold the center axel in place. 
•  Specifically identify any pinch points. 
• 

Identify  the  hazard  of  the  spool  rack  moving  due  to  line  pull  and  what  measures  are  to  be  taken  to 
remove this hazard.  

 
 

The Corrective Actions stated in this alert are one company’s attempts to address the incident,
