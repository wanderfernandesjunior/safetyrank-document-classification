Personal Flotation Devices  - Incorrect CO2 Cylinder Installation / False Positive Service Indicators 

Alert 4-05 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Recently the U.S. Coast Guard has become aware of a potential problem when installing CO2 
cylinders that have bayonet tips in inflatable personal flotation devices (PFDs or life jackets).  If a 
cylinder is not properly installed, the PFD will not inflate with CO2.  The problem may affect several 
thousand PFDs, but the Coast Guard is only aware of one incident to date.   
 
Some Mustang, Protexion, and  Stearns/SOSpenders PFDs using Halkey-Roberts’ inflators can 
indicate a green “Ready” status when the CO2 cylinder is not properly installed.  This false positive 
green indication occurs when the cylinder-bayonet assembly is inserted in the inflator, not turned, and 
the cylinder is not ejected.   
 
Cylinders with bayonet tips are designed to be pushed in and turned 1/8th turn clockwise to a full stop 
to secure the cylinder.  When the cylinder is not turned to secure it in place, the PFD will not inflate 
with CO2.  The PFD may still be inflated orally.  If the CO2 cylinder is not turned, the mechanism is 
supposed to eject it.  In some production units a false positive green indication can be achieved by 
simply pushing the cylinder into the mechanism without turning it 1/8th turn to a full stop.  According to 
the consumer report, a user was led to believe the cylinder-bayonet was properly engaged without 
turning it due to the firm seating of the cylinder-bayonet, which also prevented the cylinder-bayonet 
from ejecting as designed. 
 
Consumers should check the model number of the PFD (located on the manufacturer’s label) to see if 
your PFD is affected.   The models numbers are:

Updated cylinder installation instructions are on the home pages of manufacturers’ websites and at 
the Coast Guard website listed below.  Review and follow the instructions.  Check your device to 
ensure that the inserted CO2 cylinder-bayonet has been fully turned clockwise prior to use.  
 
If your PFD inflator does not eject an unturned cylinder-bayonet, contact the PFD manufacturer for 
servicing.
