Safety Alert 

        From the International Association of Drilling Contractors 

 
ALERT 12 – 18 
 

LOOSE MACHINE GUARDING RESULTS IN MINOR INJURY 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
While  working  in  the  shaker  house,  an  employee  stepped  onto  a  grating  that  was  covering  an  auger.  The 
grating gave way and fell onto the auger, which was rotating at the time of the incident.  The employee’s foot 
did  not  make  contact  with  the  auger  and  the  emergency  stop  was  immediately  activated.    The  employee 
sustained a slight bruising to his heel.  This incident had the potential for serious injury had the person’s foot 
come in contact with the auger. 
 

WHAT CAUSED IT: 
  The fixing clips that were holding the grate in place had worked loose and were insufficient for a weight 

bearing load. 

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company did the following: 
  All employees were reminded to be aware at all times when working around rotating equipment. 
 
  The  crew  inspected  the  entire  auger  area  and  any  questionable  areas  were  replaced  with  solid  plates 

It was stressed to employees to ensure that all necessary covers and/or guards are secure. 

and non-slip paint was applied.
