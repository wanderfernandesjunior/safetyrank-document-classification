Collision Leads to Significant Near Miss 

 

 
 

 

                        Out of service crane from which the load block fell in close proximity to a nearby vessel.       
                                

 

  
   

On Dec. 16, 2018, a motor vessel collided with a facility boat landing while preparing for a 
personnel swing rope transfer. The impact caused a load block on an out-of-service crane 
to fall into the water in close proximity to the vessel.  Upon inspection, the operator found 
that the load line was broken just above the rope socket, causing the block to fall 
overboard. Severe corrosion was observed by the operator. 
 
The crane was placed out of service in 2004, and no routine maintenance had been 
performed on the crane since then.  Prior to the incident, the unsecured load block hung 
over the side of the facility.  
 
 
Therefore, BSEE recommends that operators consider the following: 
 

•  Perform at least a visual inspection of out-of-service cranes when conducting 

scheduled crane inspections;  

•  On all cranes that have been placed out of service, secure the load block and/or 

headache ball to the facility’s deck in a manner that would prevent it from falling; or 

•  Remove the load block and/or headache ball from all cranes that have been 

permanently placed out of service; and 

•  Apply the proper lubricant to all wire rope on any crane that is to be out of service for 

long periods of time.
