Strike First Fire Extinguishers 
 
Recently  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  has  become  aware  of  a  recall  notice  for  some  U.S.  Coast  Guard 
approved fire extinguishers made by the Strike First Corporation of America. 
 
Strike First has determined that the valve stem seats in a number of its 2.5 and 5 lb dry chemical fire 
extinguishers assembled between December 2002 and February 2004 may prevent the extinguisher 
from discharging properly when the lever is activated.  As a result of this condition, Strike First has 
initiated a fire extinguisher retro-fit program for these units.  Retro-fit kits are available free of charge 
by contacting your Strike First distributor, or by contacting Strike First directly. 
 
The  Coast  Guard  recommends  that  vessel  operators  verify  the  manufacturer  of  their  fire 
extinguishers, and if applicable, take the action recommended by the manufacturer.  For details visit:

Coast  Guard  Headquarters    Life  Saving  and  Fire  Safety  Standards  Division  at  202.267.0256  or
