 Safety Alert 14-15 
 

 

DON’T FEAR, STEER CLEAR  
of dredging equipment hazards 

for  regardless  of 

 
This safety alert reminds recreational boaters and 
commercial vessel operators to use caution when 
operating their vessels near areas where dredging 
operations may be taking place.  There have been 
too  many 
instances  where  outboard  motor 
propelled vessels have allided with a dredge pipe 
causing the motor to recoil into the boat and strike 
the  occupants  or  eject  them  from  the  vessel.  
Operators  should  always  be  on  the  lookout  for 
floating debris and unmarked hazards and operate 
at a speed that allows them to see and avoid the 
hazards. 
 
This  alert    also  reminds  commercial  entities 
performing dredging in waterways to make sure all 
components of pipelines are properly marked and 
accounted 
the  recreational 
boating  season  and  locations  where  dredging  is 
taking place.  Displaying proper lights and shapes 
in  accordance  with  the  Navigation  Rules  is  a 
federal requirement applicable to all inland waters 
and the U.S. side of the Great Lakes.  
  
Some  dredge  pipes  are  made  of  high  density 
polyethylene.    Although  they  are  buoyant  and 
float, they do so in a mostly-submerged manner. 
 
Unmarked  or  improperly  marked  segments  of 
dredge piping strings and equipment, un-retrieved 
piping near busy waterways, and unmarked piping 
in  congested  boating  areas  contribute 
to 
motorboat  and  sailboat  allisions.    The  result  is 
extensive  damage  to  hulls,  shafting,  rudders  and 
keels.    The  damage  often  sinks  the  involved 
vessel and causes passenger injuries and deaths.

recommends 
The  Coast  Guard  strongly 
vessel 
recreational 
operators,  boat  repair  facilities  and  others  to 
immediately 
issues  associated  with 
improperly  marked  or  unmarked  dredging 
components to the nearest Coast Guard unit.  All 
waterway  users  should  operate  at  a  safe  speed 
when  the  potential  for  hazards  such  as  dredging 
components are present. 
 
The  Coast  Guard  also  reminds  those  persons 
and  organizations  associated  with  dredging  and 
other  commercial  activities  that  cause  or  create 
navigation  hazards  to  follow  the  requirements  of 
the Navigation Rules, specifically Title 33, Chapter 
I, Subchapter E, Part 83, Subpart C, §83.27 (Rule 
27).  Failure to follow these regulations may result 
in federal fines or penalties in addition to any civil 
lawsuits that may be filed.

international  safety,  operational,  or  material  requirement.    This  bulletin  was  developed  by  the
