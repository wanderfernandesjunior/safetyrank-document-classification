IMCA Safety Flash 32/16 

These  flashes  summarise  key  safety  matters  and  incidents,  allowing  wider  dissemination  of  lessons  learnt  from  them.    The  information  below  has  been 
provided in good faith by members and should be reviewed individually by recipients, who will determine its relevance to their own operations. 

The effectiveness of the IMCA safety flash system depends on receiving reports from members in order to pass on information and avoid repeat incidents.  
Please consider adding the IMCA secretariat (1
T) to your internal distribution list for safety alerts and/or manually submitting information 
on specific incidents you consider may be relevant.  All information will be anonymised or sanitised, as appropriate.

Basic Safety and Seamanship   

Here are five different events all of which were first published by regulatory organisations or other trade bodies.  
Whilst there is no common focus, all incidents deal with omissions or potential omissions in the fundamentals of 
safety and seamanship.  

1  Don’t Lose Your Tow in Heavy Weather 

The  United  States  Coastguard  (USCG)  has  published  the  following  marine  safety  alert  to  remind  owners  and 
operators of the importance of planning for significant towing operations.  Though primarily aimed at large drilling 
rigs,  such  as  semi-submersibles,  conical  or  other  types  of 
non-standard tows, it has broad application to all offshore 
engineering activities.  

In  late  2012,  the  Kulluk,  a  conical  drilling  unit,  suffered  a 
series  of  mishaps  which  ultimately  caused  the  rig  to  run 
aground in Alaska.  An investigation was conducted by the 
USCG  and  the  associated  Report  of  Investigation  can  be 
found  1
T.  The National Transportation Safety Board also 
published  a  Marine  Accident  Brief  on  the  incident  –  see

In  early  August  of  this  year,  the  Transocean  Winter  –  a 
17,000-ton  semi-submersible  drilling  rig  –  went  hard 
aground on the west side of the Isle of Lewis, Scotland.  This 
incident is currently under investigation by the UK Maritime 
Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB).  The USCG alert notes 
that it could have similar causal factors to the Alaskan incident. 

One recommendation stemming from the USCG investigation on the Kulluk incident was the establishment of a 
workgroup to address the issues related to the towage of mobile offshore drilling units (MODUs) in high latitude 
environments.  The workgroups final report was delivered to the Coast Guard during Q2 2016.  The report provides 
valuable information for all organizations and professionals associated with towing large structures at sea, such as 
MODUs.  The full report can be found 1

2  Be Alarmed by all Alarms! 

The USCG has published the following marine safety alert regarding the possible consequences of failing to take 
proper  actions  when  faced  with  alarm  signals  from  equipment.    Recently,  1
TGuard  marine  inspectors 
experienced two different circumstances involving the alarm and control system of steering gear on board relatively 
new vessels. 

TCoast  1

The USCG safety alert notes:  

“Although neither event resulted in a marine casualty, they serve as a reminder to the potentially dangerous results 
that may occur when an alarm system is deliberately ignored.  A false sense of operational safety develops when 
crewmembers  continually  silence  what  they  consider  to  be  a  “nuisance  alarm,”  enabling  a  false  perception  of 
normalcy to develop. 

Inspectors observed on two vessels that repetitive alarms occurred every time crewmembers performed steering 
tests that attempted to move the rudder through its range of motion.  The alarms indicated that “hydraulic lock” 
events had occurred.  Each time, the alarm was simply acknowledged by the crew and the steering gear adequately 
moved the rudder.  However, no further investigation was conducted to identify the cause of the alarm. 

It is well known that close calls and near misses occur more frequently than actual incidents.  In this instance, the 
systems and alarms forewarned the operators of a problem.  By ignoring the alarms, the crewmembers accepted a 
higher level of risk and reduced their safety margins.  If the situation had been allowed to persist indefinitely, an 
unwanted incident could have occurred with potentially dire consequences. 

As the result of these events, the Coast Guard strongly recommends that owner and operators ensure the following: 

Taddress  the  management  of  nuisance  alarms  in  Safety  Management  Systems  (SMS)  and  require  immediate 
correction of their specific causes; and 

TInclude strict prohibitions against the pinning or securing of alarm acknowledgment buttons and switches. Such 
actions  should  be  deemed  as  unacceptable  corrective  measures  as  they  have  contributed  to  serious  marine 
casualties in the past. 

This safety alert is provided for informational purpose only and does not relieve any domestic or international safety, 
operational, or material requirements.”

Lifeboat Launch Capability Compromised 

Step  Change  in  Safety  has  published  the  following  safety  alert  regarding  an  incident  in  which  lifeboat  launch 
capability was compromised.  The incident occurred when scaffolding was erected in close proximity to the lifeboat.  
It  had  been  erected  to  allow  safe  access  for  sub-contract 
personnel to surrounding structures.  During a worksite visit it 
was noted that the scaffold had been erected around the winch 
chain on the aft end of the lifeboat. 

This would have rendered the lifeboat very difficult to launch.  
It was identified that the opening left to allow the winch chain 
and winch block to pass through was significantly smaller than 
the winch block itself.  On the underside of the scaffold boards 
there  was  a  scaffold  pole  support  that  would  also  have 
impaired the descent of the lifeboat.

4  Pallet Strop Hook Broke and Hit AB 

The Marine Safety Forum (MSF) has published a safety alert regarding an incident in which a strop hook broke and 
hit a crewmember.  The incident occurred during maintenance on deck.  Vessel crew discovered a roller on a winch 
that was stuck.  They decided to try and loosen it by using the rail crane fitted on the vessel.  When the crane driver 
tried to pull it loose the pallet strap hook broke off the crane hook and hit a sailor in the back.  He was severely 
injured.  

The information provided by the MSF does not record what steps were taken to secure the pallet strop hook safely 
or the medical treatment provided to the injured person.

5  Person Hit by Mud/Clay During Anchor Handling Operations 

The MSF has published a safety alert number regarding an incident in which a person was hit by mud/clay during 
anchor handling operations.  The incident occurred during recovery of anchors from the seabed.  A person was 
injured when a 50 kg lump of mud/clay rolled onto his 
back as he was checking the identification number of a 
shackle. 
injured  person  was  a  marine 
representative.  The anchor was secured on deck and 
tension  was  off  but  the  anchor  had  not  been 
disconnected and moved to the stowage area.  Most of 
the  mud/clay  had  fallen  off  during  the  recovery  but 
some mud/clay was still attached to the anchor. 

  The 

The  submitter  of  the  report  notes  that  the  injured 
person did not see the hazard and as he was leaning 
down the mud/clay rolled off and hit him over his back.  
He fell and sprained his ankle and suffered pain in his 
back as the result of the incident. 

It  should  be  noted  that 
it  remains  everyone’s 
responsibility  to  STOP  unsafe  acts  and  to  ensure  all 
persons on deck are operating in a safe manner.   

IMCA notes that the root causes of this incident are not 
in the report.  Failure to properly control the worksite, inadequate risk assessment, and inadequate supervision, 
would appear to be amongst the causal factors in this incident.
