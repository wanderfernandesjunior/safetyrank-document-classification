CAUTION TO AIS USERS 

NAVIGATING THE JAMES RIVER, YORK RIVER, UPPER CHESAPEAKE BAY, DELAWARE BAY, NEW JERSEY 

SHORE, AND, NEW YORK HARBOR AND APPROACHES 

 

YOU MAY BE INADVERTENTLY OPERATING ON DIFFERENT AIS CHANNELS 

 
 
Between July 27 and August 19, 2010, while conducting development testing of its Nationwide Auto-
matic  Identification  System  (NAIS),  the  Coast  Guard  inadvertently  tele-commanded  most  AIS  users 
transiting the Eastern United States between lower Connecticut and North Carolina to switch to AIS 
frequencies other than the AIS default frequencies (161.975 MHz - Channel 87B - 2087 and 162.025 
MHz  -  Channel  88B  -  2088).  As  a  result,  those  users  within  uniquely  defined  channel  management 
regions (as shown in the picture) will neither see nor be seen by vessels operating on the default AIS 
channels when within these regions. Similarly, vessels operating on default frequencies will not see or 
be seen by those vessels that were inadvertently 
switched  to  other  frequencies.  No  other  AIS  us-
ers or areas are impacted. 
 
One  of  the  lesser  known  and  potent  features  of 
AIS  is  its  ability  to  operate  on  multiple  channels 
within the VHF-FM marine band. This frequency 
agility  ensures  AIS  can  be  used  even  when  the 
default  channels  are  otherwise  unavailable  or 
compromised.  In  such  conditions,  competent 
authorities, such as the Coast Guard, can use an 
AIS base station to tele-command shipborne AIS 
devices  to  switch  to  other  more  appropriate 
channels  when  within  defined  regions  of  200  to 
2000  square  nautical  miles.  This  can  be  done 
automatically  (and  without  user 
intervention) 
through receipt of the AIS channel management 
message (AIS message 22) or manually entered 
via  the  AIS  Minimal  Keyboard  Display  (MKD)  or 
similar  input  device.  Once  commanded  or  ma-
nually entered, the channel management information will stay in memory for 5 weeks or until an af-
fected vessel moves more than 500 nautical miles from the defined region. AIS channel management 
commands  can  only  be  manually  overridden  or  erased  by  the  user  via  the  unit’s  channel  (regional 
frequencies)  management  function1  or  automatically  overridden  via  another  channel  management 

                                                 
 
 
 
 
 
 

message  for  the  same  defined  region.  Reinitializing  or  resetting  your  AIS  or  transmission  channels 
will not necessarily reprogram your unit back to the default channels.  
 
Commencing September 1st and continuing for the subsequent 5 weeks, the Coast Guard will broad-
cast new channel management messages that will tele-command all AIS users back to default chan-
nels.    This  broadcast  will  occur  each  hour  between  hh.05:30  and  hh.05:59,  but  may  change  as 
needed. To ensure that these messages are received, they will be broadcast on Channel 70--Digital 
Selective  Calling  (DSC),  which  is  also  monitored  by  all  type-certified  shipboard  AIS.  While  this  will 
ensure all AIS users will get the message regardless of what AIS channel the unit is operating on, it 
could however cause a minor inconvenience to owners of older DSC radios who may receive an alert 
(tone) upon receipt of this message.  It will have no other effect on DSC radios. 
 
AIS users are encouraged to inform others whom they believe may be affected and are therefore not 
being seen by others. All AIS users are reminded to maintain their AIS in effective operating condition 
and to validate their AIS data prior to each voyage and as needed. 
 
This safety alert is provided for informational purposes only and does not relieve any domestic or in-
ternational  safety,  operational  or  material  requirement.  The  Coast  Guard  has  developed  policy  and 
procedures to ensure such inadvertent broadcast do not happen again and we apologize for any in-
convenience  this  may  have  caused.  For  further  information  on  AIS  Channel  Management  or  repro-
gramming  your  AIS  read  FAQ#19  at  www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=AISFAQ#19  or  contact

gions in this pane you are not affected and need do nothing.
