Tensioner Failure

What happened? 

In Australian waters, two separate incidents have occurred recently on semi-submersible 
MODUs. Each incident involved a guide line or pod line tensioner operated Rod End 
Down (RED).  In each case, the wire rope parted, releasing the load on the tensioner 
and allowing the tensioner piston to stroke downwards in an unrestrained manner until it 
came into contact with the end cover plate of the cylinder.  The impact of the piston on 
the end of the cylinder was severe enough to cause damage.  In the first case the 
mounting bolts fractured allowing the complete tensioner unit to fall to the deck.  In the 
second case, the bottom cover plate securing bolts fractured, allowing the piston 
assembly to come out of the cylinder and land on the grating below. 

Both of these incidents had the potential to cause fatal injuries if persons had been in the 
vicinity. 

What could go wrong? 

If a tensioner wire rope breaks, the load on the tensioner piston is suddenly released. 
The HP air pressure on top of the piston will force the piston to stroke out to the end of 
the cylinder in an unrestrained manner.  To prevent this from happening, tensioners 
operating RED have the following design safety feature built into them. (See the sketch 
attached to the end of this alert). 

When the piston moves downwards, it forces the hydraulic fluid in the lower part of the 
cylinder through an orifice plate and into the LP hydraulic fluid reservoir.  For 
unrestrained motion of the piston, the flow of hydraulic fluid through the restriction of the 
orifice plate will be sufficient to restrain the speed of the piston and allow it to safely 
come to rest against the cylinder end cover plate without causing any damage. 

In both of these incidents, the operator was unaware that hydraulic fluid had 
inadvertently become displaced by air.  When the wire rope broke, the piston speed was 
unrestrained because of the lack of hydraulic fluid in the lower part of the cylinder.  
Damage was caused by the collision impact of the piston into the end of the cylinder. 

For tensioners operating RED, this design safety feature incorporates a small purging 
non-return valve fitted into the piston rod just under the piston. The downstream side of 
the non-return valve is connected via a flexible hose back to the LP reservoir.  When the 
piston is stroking downwards, hydraulic fluid is forced through the orifice plate at the 
bottom of the cylinder.  This creates a small overpressure in the tensioner cylinder 
relative to the LP reservoir.  The overpressure is sufficient to lift the non-return valve off 
its seat.  Any HP air that has leaked past the piston seals will be vented through the 
open non-return valve and into the LP reservoir.  When the piston rod moves upwards 
again, the non-return valve will close.  The action of the purging non-return valve will 
keep the lower part of the cylinder purged of air and full of hydraulic fluid.  It is therefore 
essential in maintaining the integrity of this design safety feature. 

This design safety feature can be compromised by an air build up which replaces the 
hydraulic fluid in the lower part of the tensioner cylinder. The most common causes are:- 

• 

If the HP air leakage rate past the piston seals is high enough, the action of the 
purging non-return valve will not have the capacity to purge all of the air from the 
lower part of the cylinder.

• 
• 

If the purging non-return valve becomes blocked. 
If the hydraulic fluid level is not maintained. 

Under these circumstances, there will be no hydraulic fluid system protection to prevent 
unrestrained piston movement should a tensioner wire rope break. 

Key Lessons: 

Hydraulic System 

From the investigation of these two incidents it was found that:- 

•  There was no maintenance procedure or built in system for detecting piston seal 

leakage rates, in particular, leakage rates high enough to cause the hydraulic 
fluid to be ejected from the lower part of the tensioner cylinder back into the LP 
reservoir.  Before one of the tensioner failures occurred, the operator had noticed 
air and hydraulic fluid mist being vented from the LP air pressure regulator in the 
control cabinet.  The LP air pressure regulator is used to maintain the air 
pressure on top of the hydraulic fluid in the tensioner LP reservoir.  The operator 
had not linked the cause of this venting to possible piston seal leakage and 
failure in one of the tensioners. 

•  Other than at the end of a well (EOW), there was no system or procedure in 

place for determining if the correct quantity of hydraulic fluid was present in the 
LP side of the tensioner.  At EOW, when the tensioner was not in service, the 
procedure used was the method given in the manufacturer’s manual.  This 
required the piston to be fully stroked out then fully retracted before checking that 
the fluid level was visible in the lower sight glass of the LP reservoir. 

•  There was no maintenance procedure used to determine if the purging non-

return valve was operating correctly. 

Wire Rope 

•  One wire rope broke at the tensioner turn down sheave due to wire fatigue.  The 

normal procedure used to change the wear points in a wire rope is by slipping 
and cutting.  For a tensioner, this is normally carried out when the tensioner is 
not in use, usually at EOW.  On this occasion, the rope had been in constant use 
for a period three times longer than normal because the rig remained on the 
same location to drill a multilateral well.  The deteriorating condition of the rope at 
the wear points had not been noticed by the operator until the rope parted. 

• 

In the second incident, the wire rope had jumped the sheave at a time when 
adjustments were being made to the tensioner and the tensioner was not under 
load.  When the tensioner was returned to service, the wire rope was left rubbing 
against the shaft and mounting plate for the sheaves.  This situation remained 
unnoticed until the wire rope parted five days later.
