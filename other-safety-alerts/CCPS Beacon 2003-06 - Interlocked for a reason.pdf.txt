The main gas valve was opened and gas filled the heater. Then–K A B O O MK A B O O M, the heater exploded destroying the casing and damaging several tubes.

Don™t Defeat it !Every Protective Device has a Purpose. Don™t Defeat it !What Can You Do?ŁAlways use interlocks and other protective systems as they are intended to be used. ŁMake sure that they are properly calibrated and receive needed maintenance so that they work when needed.ŁNever disable an interlock or other protective device unless a Management of Change has been completed and approved.ŁFollow established start up procedures. If they are not correct, tell your supervisor and get them corrected.ŁDon™t make untested or unapproved changes just this one time.Interlocked for a Reason–Interlocked for a Reason––a Very Good Reason !–a Very Good Reason !Why Did this Happen?The operator thought that he could speed up the job by shortcutting some of the ﬁunnecessaryﬂ things in the start up procedure. He misjudged the importance of the interlocks. He thought they could be by-passed–just this one time, but he was wrong. They were important –– this time and every time!PSID MembersŠcheck the following incidents--*137, *149, *317 and *343.
