SAFETY ALERT 30 

Quality Variations Discovered in Oil and Gas Pipe Components 
made from Duplex Steel 

What happened? 

NOPSA has received information from the Petroleum Safety Authority of Norway (PSA) 
about quality variations in certain oil and gas pipe components made of duplex steel. 
The PSA reports that the deviation in quality does not show on the material certificates 
and could involve a higher risk of brittle fractures.  The cause of the quality deviation is 
believed to be faulty heat treatment by the manufacturer.  

 
The PSA indicates in its safety alert1 to industry that pipe components with the quality 
variation have been delivered worldwide since the beginning of 2006.  

The US Offshore Minerals Management (MMS) Regulatory Compliance division has also 
released an alert2 on the quality variations discovered in certain oil and gas pipe 
components which are used by oil and gas operators for a wide range of applications 
including hydrocarbon production pipes and water transportation pipes. 

Key Lessons: 

NOPSA does not have information that indicates whether or not these pipe fittings are 
being used by operators in Australia. It is recommended that operators review the 
information provided by the PSA and MMS and determine whether any further action is 
necessary.
