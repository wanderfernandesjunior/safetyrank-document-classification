Safety Alert 

        From the International Association of Drilling Contractors 

 
ALERT 12 – 31  
 

HIGH POTENTIAL - DROPPED PONY COLLAR 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
While  laying  down  an  approximately  16  foot  x  10  inch  (4.8m  x  25cm)  pony  collar,  weighing  approximately 
3400 pounds (1.5mt), the 500 ton (454mt) center-latch elevators opened inadvertently.  The pony collar fell 6 
feet (2m) and came to rest on the pipe skate.  In the process of falling, the lift cap struck the stump, but there 
was no visible damage to the remaining BHA.  No personnel were in the area. 
 

WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
•  Defective  and  inadequate  equipment:  While  being  operated  in  accordance  with  the  2009  manual,  the 

center-latch elevator failed and resulted in the dropped pony collar.  
Inadequate information/data: The 2009 version of the Manufacturer’s Operator Manual was used as the 
reference manual.  As far as the company and the drilling crew knew, the 2009 version WAS the latest 
version,  but  after  the  incident  occurred  the  company  found  out  from  the  Manufacturer/Equipment 
Provider  there  was  a  2012  version.    In  the  2012  Operator  Manual,  which  had  not  been  sent  by  the 
Equipment Provider to the company, the use of the center-latch elevators is not allowed for this type of 
lift or lay down; instead, rotating elevators are required. 
Inadequate engineering/manufacturing: Design of the center-latch elevator is not compatible with laying 
down a pony collar. 
Inadequate  maintenance  of  standards/procedures/work  instructions:  Unavailability  onsite  of  the  inserts 
for the rotating elevators led the crew to use the center-latch elevators as a substitute, which was noted 
as  an  acceptable  substitution  in  the  2009  Operator  Manual.    It  is  not  an  acceptable  substitution  in  the 
2012 version.  
Inadequate  communication:  The  process  for  communication  of  updated  manufacturers’  technical 
documents and manuals was not well defined.
