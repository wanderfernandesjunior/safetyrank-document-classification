EQUIPMENT FAILURE – LOW PRESSURE VALVE 

USED TO FILL CASING FAILS

The rig crew was in the process of running casing in the hole.  A mud line with a low-pressure valve was being 
used  to  fill  the  casing.    At  one  point  while  filling  the  casing  with  mud,  the  floorman  closed  the  fill  line  valve 
when  the  casing  was  full.    When  the  valve  was  closed,  pressure  built  up  and  the  pressure  surpassed  the 
working pressure of the valve.  The floorman was struck with debris and required medical attention resulting in 
a lost time incident.   
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
The rig’s high-pressure mud pump was being use to fill the casing.  The fill line components did not meet the 
pressure rating of the mud pump.   
 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company did the following:   
 
•  The casing fill up piping system was changed so that it could only be used with a centrifugal pump in the 

•  A proper ball type valve with a 90-degree filling extension was installed to fill casing. 
•
