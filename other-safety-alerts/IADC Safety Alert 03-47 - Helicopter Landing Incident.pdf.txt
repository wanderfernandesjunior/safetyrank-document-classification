ALERT 03 – 47 
 

HELICOPTER LANDING INCIDENT 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
Recently an incident occurred while a helicopter was attempting to land on a MODU that was undertow.  The 
helicopter approached the heliport from the bow and as it was coming in the tail rotor struck and cut off two 
antennas on top of the Ballast Control room adjacent to the heliport. 
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
•  Rig was being towed at a rate of 6 knots.  
•  Wind direction was from the Port coming across the heliport at 18 – 20 mph.  
•  Helicopter pilot misjudged the forward movement of the rig under tow.  
•  Helicopter pilot misjudged the helicopter-landing target while walking the helicopter toward the heliport.  
 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company issued the following directives to 
their rig OIMs: 
 
•  Never allow a helicopter to land on a towed vessel unless the tow speed is less than 2.5 knots and the 

wind conditions across the heliport are favorable for a safe landing.  

•  All personnel must remain out of the immediate area, including adjacent structures, during helicopter take-

off and landing operations. 

 

The Corrective Actions stated in this alert are one company’s attempts to address the incident, and do not 

necessarily reflect the position of IADC or the IADC HSE Committee.
