IMCA Safety Flash 06/08 

Safety Flash 

April 2008 

These  flashes  summarise  key  safety  matters  and  incidents,  allowing  wider  dissemination  of  lessons  learned  from  them.    The  information  below  has  been 
provided in good faith by members and should be reviewed individually by recipients, who will determine its relevance to their own operations. 

The effectiveness of the IMCA safety flash system depends on receiving reports from members in order to pass on information and avoid repeat incidents.  
Please consider adding the IMCA secretariat (imca@imca-int.com) to your internal distribution list for safety alerts and/or manually submitting information 
on specific incidents you consider may be relevant.  All information will be anonymised or sanitised, as appropriate. 

A  number  of  other  organisations  issue  safety  flashes  and  similar  documents  which  may  be  of  interest  to  IMCA  members.    Where  these  are  particularly 
relevant, these may be summarised or highlighted here.  Links to known relevant websites are provided at www.imca-int.com/links   Additional links should 
be submitted to webmaster@imca-int.com 

 

1  Sikorsky S76A+ and S76A++ Helicopters 

Members  using  Sikorsky  S76A+  and  S76A++  helicopters  are  referred  to  the  attached  safety  alert,  originally  issued  via  the 
OGP safety zone website (http://info.ogp.org.uk/safety) concerning engine failures resulting from faults in tachometer boxes 
on these aircraft and the recommended remedy. 

 

 

 
Safety Alert 
 
Sikorsky S76A+ and S76A++ Helicopters 
 
 
Applies to BHP Billiton contracted Sikorsky S76A+ and S76A++ 
helicopters fitted with Turbomeca Ariel 1S or 1S1 engines. 
 
Sikorsky S76 twin engine helicopters equipped with Turbomeca Ariel 1S or 1S1 
engines are fitted with engine overspeed sensors designed to shutdown an engine to 
prevent catastrophic damage in the event of an engine overspeed.  Once an engine 
has been shutdown by this protection system it cannot be restarted in flight as the 
overspeed protection system is inaccessible to the flight crew and can only be reset 
on the ground.  The overspeed protection is incorporated into a component known as 
the Tachometer Box with two installed on each helicopter, one for each engine. 
 
BHP Billiton has experienced two separate over water in flight engine shutdowns 
resulting from false overspeed indications.  In both events the helicopter was flown 
back to an onshore location and landed safely with the one remaining operative 
engine.  Investigation by the engine manufacturer, Turbomeca, revealed that failures 
of the overspeed protection system resulted from ingress of moisture and internal 
corrosion.   
 
In response to the failures on BHP Billiton contracted aircraft and other known 
events, Turbomeca has developed a replacement Tachometer Box with improved 
sealing to address the issue of moisture ingress and internal corrosion.   The 
replacement of existing Tachometer Boxes with the improved part is recommended 
by Turbomeca in Service Bulletin 292 77 0330 for helicopters operating in humidity 
saturated environments which is typical of BHP Billiton offshore petroleum 
operations. 
 
Sikorsky S76A+ and S76A++ helicopters that are not compliant with Service 
Bulletin 292 77 0330 (Incorporation of Modification TU 330) by 10 July 2008 
shall not be used by BHP Billiton. 
 
BHP Billiton assets using or are likely to use Sikorsky S76A+ or S76A++ helicopters 
are to verify helicopter operators have incorporated Modification TU 330 before using  
these helicopters beyond 10 July 2008.
