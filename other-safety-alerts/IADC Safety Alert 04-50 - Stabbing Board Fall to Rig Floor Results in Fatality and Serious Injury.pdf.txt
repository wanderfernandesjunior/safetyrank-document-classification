STABBING BOARD FALL TO RIG FLOOR 

RESULTED IN A FATALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY 

 
ALERT 04 – 50 

WHAT HAPPENED: 

While running 14” casing the electrical hoist of the casing stabbing board failed.  After a first attempt to repair 
the  motor  without  success,  the  management  onboard  the  rig  decided  to  proceed  with  the  operations 
replacing the electrical hoist with a manual chain block.  The derrick man with the help of the driller and of an 
electrician connected the manual hoist to the electrical hoist at approx. 15 meters (50 ft) above the rig floor.  
As  soon  this  operation  was  completed  the  casing  job  resumed.    The  derrick  man  had  to  lift  the  casing 
stabbing  board  to  disconnect  the  single  joint  elevator  and  connect  the  elevator.    To  lift  the  board,  he 
disengaged  the  upper  safety  dogs  that  were  keeping  the  platform  in  position.    As  soon  he  completed  this 
operation the stabbing board slipped approximately 40 cm (16 in) before the chain snapped and the stabbing 
board fell.  The driller who was standing between the doghouse and the rotary table in order to supervise the 
casing operation was struck and thrown to the drill floor.  He struck his head against the platform used for the 
casing operations located near the rotary table and sustained fatal injuries.  The derrick man was seriously 
injured and was evacuated by helicopter.

•  The stabbing board was installed without the safety stopper plate at the bottom of the rail 
•  The lifting gear used was not part of the rig’s lifting register 
•  The Derrick man did not connect properly the safety belt he was wearing 
•  The safety working load of the manual chain block was not in accordance with the requirements 
•  The derrick man did not use the primary safety dogs to keep the stabbing board in position and the chain 

was not in tension at the moment he released the upper safety dogs.
