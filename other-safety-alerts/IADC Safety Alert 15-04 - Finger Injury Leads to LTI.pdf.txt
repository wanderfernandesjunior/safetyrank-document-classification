Safety Alert 

        From the International Association of Drilling Contractors 

 
ALERT 15 – 04  
 

FINGER INJURY LEADS TO LTI 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
Roustabout was requested to assist on a cargo handling operation from the Main Deck. The task was to 
connect the crane hook to the slings of a pup joint bundle. The bundle was to be sent over to a platform with 
the use of the crane. When the Roustabout, who was working on his own, signaled to the Crane Operator to 
pick up the load,  movement of the rig allowed the bundle of pup joints to sway in the direction of the 
Roustabout and he pinched his right hand between two joints, thus injuring two fingers in the process. After 
receiving X-rays it was diagnosed that both fingers had sustained fractures. 
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
•  Standing too close to the load as it was hoisting. 
•  Using Team Member that was not originally part of the task 
•  Failure to use taglines and/or push poles to control the load 
•  Failure to follow the correct rigging and lifting techniques by using only one man for the job. 
•  Failing to think about the risks involved. 
•  Not utilizing the stop work authority. 
 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company did the following: 
•  No job is so important that we cannot take the time to do it safely. 
•  A JHA for the task should have been completed and discussed with crew. 
•  Team Members to stand clear of load while hoisted and using proper taglines and handling tools 
•  Supervisors to understand situational changes. 
•  Use safety interventions such as Step back 5 x 5 and the Stop Work Authority when required. 
•  Time to be taken to have correct amount of people to do the job at all times. 
 
 
 

The Corrective Actions stated in this alert are one company’s attempts to address the incident, and do not
