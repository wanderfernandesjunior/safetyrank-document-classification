Recently during routine inspections several U.S. 
Coast Guard offices have discovered defective 
lifejacket lights made by PROSAR Technologies. 
Some of these lights were found with very noticeable 
deformations due to battery corrosion while others 
appeared perfectly normal but did not work when 
tested. Attempts to contact the manufacturer for 
repair or replacement of this equipment failed 
because the company is no longer in business. 

The U.S. Coast Guard is canceling all approvals 
for PROSAR Technologies lifesaving equipment 
because of the lights which have failed during testing 
and due to the fact that quality control of all their 
safety products cannot be verified. 

Lifejacket and floating water lights no longer approved:
