ALERT 03 – 11 
 

CABLE CAUGHT IN ROTARY HOSE CLAMP 

RESULTS IN NEAR MISS 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
While lowering the block after completion of wire line logging operation, the port aft man-rider winch cable became hooked 
on the TDS mud safety chain clamp. This action caused increased tension on the cable, breaking the crown sheave swivel 
retaining pin, side plate and 2 safety slings. The sheave and line dropped 50 feet to just below monkey board level where it 
got hooked up on the block hang off line. The sheave retaining pin lock nut dropped to the starboard drill floor wind wall 
roof. 
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
 
After using the man rider the operator had checked the line 
and  made  it  tight,  but  had  not  noticed  that  it  was  caught 
behind  the  mud  hose  clamp,  positioned  85  feet  above  the 
rig  floor.    Design  of  the  mud  hose  clamp  which  has  a

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this issue this company did the following.   
 
•  Revised the JSA for Logging to include a step to check the personnel hoist cable to ensure it is clear of the top drive 

 

•  Modified the clamp in such a way that wire does not get
