ALERT 3-18 

 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
While starting up the control system for the BOP stack during maintenance activities, there was a 
release of hydraulic fluid from a small bore tubing which had separated from the 3,000 PSI manifold of 
the system. An estimated 196 litres (51 gallons) of fluid was released from the system into a bunded 
area.  

CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 

 
 
 
The failed section of pipework was sent onshore for failure mode analysis, which revealed the cause to 
be a fatigue fracture caused by deep bite marks, resulting from excessive tightening of the compression 
nut.  Inspection of the unit identified several fittings that had also been overtightened.  
 

 
 
 

 

A Safety Alert can consist of any type of health, safety & environment (HSE) notification or    

Near Miss/Near Hit alert.  Proactive Alerts on jobs well done are also encouraged. 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

LESSONS LEARNED: 
 
Inspect piping and tubing connections and ensure there are no loose or over tightened connections.  

Consider marking correctly torqued connections to easily identify which have been torqued. 

Use gauge/tool provided by manufacturer to avoid damaging small bore tubing.
