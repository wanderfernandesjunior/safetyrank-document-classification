 Safety Alert 04-16 

Distressed Distress Signal 

A potentially dangerous issue. 

 
The Coast  Guard has withdrawn the Certificate of Approval (160.037/23/0) for NAMMO LIAB AB 
Orange Smoke Hand Distress Signal, and the approval status of this certificate is now marked as 
“Former-  Do  Not  Use.”    This  action  was  taken  because  the  chemical  makeup  of  the  signal  was 
changed in October 2013 without Coast Guard approval and the signal that was manufactured is at 
risk of spontaneous combustion when dropped. 
 
These  smoke  signals  may  be  labeled and  marketed  as  “Polar  MK  4”  by  NAMMO  LIAB  AB  or  as 
“IKAROS” by Hansson Pyrotech.  “IKAROS” Hansson Pyrotech is the more current manufacturing 
name.    Datrex  Inc.,  of  Kinder,  LA,  is  the  only  distributor  for  these  products  in  the  United  States. 
There are approximately 2,790 signals with the potentially defect in the US market.  
 
Datrex has removed all of its remaining stock from sale and is working with customers to replace 
these  potentially  dangerous  signals.      Any  signal  manufactured  after  October  2013  must  be 
properly disposed of and replaced with a product that satisfies the vessel’s carriage requirements.  
For questions or concerns, contact Datrex at 337-738-4511 or via email at datrex@datrex.com. 
 
This safety alert was developed by the Coast Guard Office of Design and Engineering Standards 
and distributed by the Office of Investigations and Casualty Analysis.  Any questions, comments, 
or incidences of accidental ignition involving these signals under this Certificate of Approval should 
be sent to sent to: HQS-PF-fldr-CG-INV@uscg.mil
