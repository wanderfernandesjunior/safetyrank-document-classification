WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
While attempting to work on a prototype pipe testing fixture the operator’s coverall sleeve was caught on the 
cycle/rpm  counter  arm  which  is  attached  to  a  rotating  shaft.  (Figs.1  &  2)    The  counter  arm  wrapped  his 
sleeve  around  the  shaft  ultimately  pulling  him  violently  around  the  equipment  stand.  (Figs.  3  &  4)      He 
suffered multiple fractures of the arm.
