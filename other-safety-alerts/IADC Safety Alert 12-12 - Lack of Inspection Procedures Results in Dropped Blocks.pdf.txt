Safety Alert 

        From the International Association of Drilling Contractors 

 
ALERT 12 – 12  
 

LACK OF INSPECTION PROCEDURES RESULTS  

IN DROPPED BLOCKS 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
The crew was tripping in to the well when the driller pushed down on the brake handle and realized that he 
had lost brake control.  The block came down hitting the well head and rested next to the well.  When the 
block dropped to the ground, it caused a backlash in the drill line.  This allowed the drill line socket to release 
from the drum where it hung up in the sheave guard in the crown and caused damage to the guard. 
 

WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
Upon investigation, it was learned that a square pin which ties two components of the brake system together 
had fallen out.  Upon inspection of other rigs, it was found that one rig had a worn square pin and on another 
rig, the square pin had worked its way half way out.  The investigation also revealed that the brake linkage 
systems were not being inspected on a regular basis. 

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company did the following: 
 
1. 
2. 

Instructed all divisions to check their rig’s brake systems to ensure proper key placement.  
Instructed rig  personnel  to  ensure  that the  brake system  is  greased  twice  a week and  the  hoisting 
system is visually checked daily.   
Directed Managers to distribute the alert to all divisions and discuss with all employees.
