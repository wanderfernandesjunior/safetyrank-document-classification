       Alert 3-19 
 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
At the time of the incident, the drill crew was tripping in the hole with 4” drill pipe. While the next stand was being 
moved into position with the racking arms, the racker operator, in an attempt to gain the attention of the 
roughnecks, began to knock on the racker unit window pane.  
 
The racker operator wanted to confirm with the roughnecks that the pin of the stand had been lubricated with pipe 
dope and was clear of the elevators. While knocking on the window pane, the pane dislodged from the window 
frame and fell approximately 13.5 ft to the drill floor. The pane came to rest on the mouse hole, the roughnecks 
were standing clear of the area and no one was struck. 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 

CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 
 

•  Racker operator knocking on the window 
•  Durability – The condition of the window seal had been affected by Oil Based Mud (OBM) contamination  
•  Communication pathways – Racker Operator did not use the installed talkback system to communicate 

with the roughnecks  

•  Drops perception – Failure to recognize the drops potential presented by the windows on the racker cabs  

 

LESSONS LEARNED: 
 

 

•  All windows on the drill floor & racker cabs were immediately checked to ensure they were secure 
•  Safety stand down held with the Drill Crew, Senior Toolpusher, OIM and Drilling Supervisor 
•  All personnel informed of incident at pre-tour meetings and “Flash Alert” sent for sharing 
•  Temporary window and retention fitted and secured to racker cab 
•  Additional rig wide drops sweeps carried out by all departments in all areas  
•  Secondary retention devices fitted to the exterior of the racker cab windows 
•  Windows and seals of racker cabs to be added to the racker cab inspection schedule, along with 

the inspection of the seals as part of pre-use checks 

•  Create a pre-use checklist for the racker cabs 
• 

Investigate the potential to re-configure the Driller’s talk back system to allow direct 
communication from the racker cabs to the drill floor
