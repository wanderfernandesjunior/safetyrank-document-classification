DROPPED STAND OF DRILL COLLARS RESULTS IN NEAR-MISS 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
While Pulling Out Of the Hole with the Bottom Hole Assembly, one stand 9.5” drill collar fell across the derrick due to 
improper securing of the air winch chain on the monkey board.  The derrick man tightened the chain around the drill 
collar with only one wrap instead of two wraps, and he didn’t make a knot as supposed to be, so the chain came loose 
and the stand of the DC fell across the derrick.  Luckily no injuries occurred to personnel or damage in the rig floor area.   
 

Possible Outcome 
 
In  the  worst-case  scenario  the  dropped  DC  could  have  hit  a  crewmember  causing  serious  body 
injury or fatality and damage to rig floor equipment. 

Inadequate following of procedure.
