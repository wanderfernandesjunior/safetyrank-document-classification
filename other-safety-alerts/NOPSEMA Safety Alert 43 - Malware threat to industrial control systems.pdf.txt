SAFETY ALERT 43 

  

 

Malware Threat to Industrial Control Systems 

What happened? 

IT security researchers have identified malware that is specifically designed to search 
out and attack supervisory, control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. It is believed 
that the main means of spreading this malicious code is via USB storage devices. 

When the USB storage device is opened in Windows Explorer, or any other file manager 
that can display file icons, the exploit uses a previously undetected vulnerability in 
Windows to infect the operating system.  

The exploit triggers even if the autostart function in Windows is completely disabled. No 
file has to be opened for the infection to take place. 

What could go wrong? 

The exploit could allow third parties to interfere with SCADA systems, potentially causing 
an increase in demand on independent safety related systems through maloperation of a 
process. 

Key Lessons: 

While this malware appears to be aimed specifically at Siemens systems, it establishes 
the principle that it is possible to create malicious code specifically aimed at SCADA 
systems, and serves as a timely reminder to Operators to ensure that effective 
measures are in place to guard against malware infection. 

As the malware uses root kit techniques, there is the possibility that it cannot be 
detected on a running system. Users of Siemensâ€™ WinCC or Step7 software should 
therefore scan their systems with current antivirus-software using a rescue CD. For 
details you should contact your local antivirus support.
