WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
The pictures below show the outcome when the mud pump relief valve popped at +/- 4900 psi and the bolts 
on the anchor clamp on the mud tank failed.  The rig had just repaired the module on the same mud pump 
and was back online circulating when the pop off blew.  Fortunately there were no personnel present in the 
area and subsequently no injury to personnel.
