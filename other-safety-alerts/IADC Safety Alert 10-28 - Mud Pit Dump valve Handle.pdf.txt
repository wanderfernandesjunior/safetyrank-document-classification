Safety Alert 

        From the International Association of Drilling Contractors 

 
ALERT 10 – 28 
 

MUD PIT DUMP VALVE HANDLE 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
While closing a dump valve on a reserve mud pit, an employee was struck in the mouth with the handle of 
the dump valve.  The incident resulted in a laceration to his upper lip and three broken teeth.  
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
The employee leaned across the valve head placing his face in a direct line of contact with the valve handle.  
While in this position he proceeded to pull the handle to close the valve.  This particular type of dump valve is 
designed with a spring loaded valve handle that can result in a quick forceful up and downward motion when 
activated.    A  combination  effect  of  hydrostatic  pressure  and  suction  reaction  resulted  in  a  forceful  upward 
motion of the valve handle, extending it from the existing 19” in the open position to the full 36” height in the 
closed position.   
 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company instructed rig personnel:   
 
  Conduct a survey on the type and positions of dump valve handles to ensure proper measures are taken 

to prevent incident occurrence on your rig.    

  Discuss with all crewmembers the importance of proper body placement while performing job tasks.  
 
 

The Corrective Actions stated in this alert are one company’s attempts to address the incident,  

and do not necessarily reflect the position of IADC or the IADC HSE Committee.
