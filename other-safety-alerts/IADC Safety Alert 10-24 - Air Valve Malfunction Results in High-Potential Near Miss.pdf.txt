Safety Alert 

        From the International Association of Drilling Contractors 

 
ALERT 10 – 24 

AIR VALVE MALFUNCTION RESULTS 

IN HIGH-POTENTIAL NEAR MISS 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
The  driller  was  in  the  process  of  back  reaming  when  the  air  supply  to  the  drum  clutch  of  the  draw  works 
suddenly bled off.  This allowed the drum clutch to release and the top drive system, with a 5-inch drill string 
attached, to move down approximately 4-meters (13 feet).  The drill pipe elevators came in contact with the 
rotary table resulting in damage to the bails and the link tilt hydraulic cylinders. 
 

 

WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
Combination of leaking o-rings and the valve “tattletale hole” being plugged.  
 

  The o-rings were found to be brittle and allowed air to leak by the shaft into the end cap.  
  The “tattletale” hole was found to be plugged causing the pressure leaking by the o-rings to build up 

in the end cap exerting internal pressure against the end of the valve. 

  The reverse pressure shifted the valve into the vent position which shut off the air to, and dumped air 

from, the drum clutch.
