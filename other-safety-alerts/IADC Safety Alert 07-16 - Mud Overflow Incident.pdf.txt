Safety Alert 

        From the International Association of Drilling Contractors 

 
ALERT 07 – 16 
 

MUD OVERFLOW INCIDENT 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
While filling a trip tank with drilling fluid, the Driller started another task and failed to monitor the progress of 
drilling fluid entering the tank.  The overflow return line could not cope with the volume of fluid and eventually 
the tank overflowed. 
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
•  The Driller did not identify the importance of visual monitoring during this operation and left the control 

console.  This resulted in the driller not being able to see the “tank rise” visual alarm.   

•  The audible alarm had been disconnected due to continuous malfunction.   
•  The diameter of the overflow return line was not large enough to cope with the volume of fluid entering 

the tank. 

 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company did the following:   
 
Instructed Rig Personnel and Supervisors to do the following:  
 
• 
• 

Inspect all visual and audible alarms on all mud control and return systems and tanks. 
Inspect tank overflow return lines on all similar tanks to ensure it is sufficient diameter to cope with the 
volume of fluid if there is an overflow. 

•  Review the importance of continually manning the Driller’s console at safety meetings. 
•  Review  incident  reporting and  accountability  requirements  contained  in  Safety  Management  System  at 

safety meetings. 

 

The Corrective Actions stated in this alert are one company’s attempts to address the incident,  

and do not necessarily reflect the position of IADC or the IADC HSE Committee.
