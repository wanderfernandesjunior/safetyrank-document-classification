MARINER’S SAFETY ENDANGERED 

 WHEN VHF RADIO DISTRESS ALERTS BY DIGITAL SELECTIVE CALLING (DSC) 

LACK LOCATION AND IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION 

 
As  the  Coast  Guard’s  new  marine  radio  network  Rescue  21  becomes  operational  throughout  the 
U.S., rescue centers can now receive instant distress alerts from commonly used DSC-capable VHF 
marine  radios.    However,  approximately  90%  of  VHF  DSC  distress  alerts  received  by  the  Coast 
Guard  do  not  contain  position  information,  and  approximately  60%  do  not  contain  a  registered 
identity.   The Coast Guard cannot effectively respond to a DSC distress alert sent from such a radio.   
 
 
This means that search and rescue efforts may normally be suspended when:   
 

•  no communications with the distressed vessel can be established,  
•  no further information or means of contacting the vessel can be obtained from other sources, 

and  

. 

•  no position information is known.   

HELP US  HELP YOU 

 
FIRST  Obtain  a  Maritime  Mobile  Installation  Identity  (MMSI)  and  enter  it  into  your  radio.  MMSI 
numbers are issued by the Federal Communications Commission if your vessel otherwise requires a 
station license, or BOATUS, (http://www.boatus.com/mmsi), Sea Tow (http://www.seatow.com/mmsi), 
or  the  U.S.  Power  Squadrons  (http://www.usps.org/php/mmsi).    Ensure  any  information  originally 
provided  is  updated  as  changes  occur.  FCC  regulations  require  that  DSC-equipped  radios  “use 
MMSIs assigned by the Commission or its designees” (47 CFR 80.103(b)).   
 
THEN Interconnect your radio to a GPS receiver using a two-wire NMEA 0183 interface on all DSC-
equipped marine radios and on most GPS receivers.  Instructions should be provided in the radio and 
GPS  operators  manual.    Further  information  is  provided  and  will  be  routinely  updated  in
