Be ready with a proper Fireman’s Outfit.  

Deficiencies related to firefighting safety and appliances continue to be the leading cause of detentions 
in  the  San  Francisco  area.  Moreover,  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2018,  there  was  an  increase  in 
deficiencies that related to missing or unserviceable fireman’s outfits. A fireman’s outfit is essential to 
adequately protect the crew members from heat, smoke, and steam and allows them to attack the root 
of the fire effectively.   

The  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR)1  and  International  Convention  for  Safety  of  Life  at  Sea 
(SOLAS)2 require fireman’s outfits to be aboard certain commercial fishing, cargo, passenger, and tank 
vessels. The minimum number of fireman’s outfits required on board can range from two to four sets 
depending on the tonnage and required equipment may vary depending on service/type of vessel. They 
should be stowed in widely separate locations.   

For U.S. flagged vessels, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has established a standard 
on fireman’s outfits. NFPA 1971, Standard on Protective Ensemble for Structural Fire Fighting provides 
guidance  on  minimum  requirements  for  design,  manufacturing  and  certification  of  protective 
ensembles, to include coats, trousers, coveralls, helmets, gloves, footwear and interfacing components.  

For foreign flagged vessels, SOLAS regulations Chapter II Regulation 17 and the International Code 
for Fire Safety Systems (FSS Code) established standards for fireman’s outfits.   

The  U.S.  Coast  Guard  strongly  recommends  that  vessel  owners,  operators  and  other responsible 
parties take the following measures:  

Inspect your fireman’s outfits for functionality and fit. 

 
  Repair or replace equipment when worn or expired.    
  Practice donning the fireman’s outfit and conduct realistic drills utilizing the 
required safety equipment to ensure the crew is familiar and ready to use in 
an emergency.   

  Remedy deficiencies in accordance with their SMS before the ship enters port and report any 

unresolved issues on their advance notice of arrival.
