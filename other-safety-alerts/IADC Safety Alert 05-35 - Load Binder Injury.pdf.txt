LOAD BINDER INJURY 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
An injury recently occurred on a company rig when a truck driver was unlatching one of the load binders on 
his trailer.  The employee was struck in the face by the cheater pipe placed on the handle of the binder when 
it sprang open unexpectedly.  This is the second injury of this type within the year.  In addition, other similar 
injuries have occurred while opening or closing load binders. 
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
•  The employee was using a regular break over style load binder which presents a great risk to the user.  
•  Recommended use of ratchet type load binders as per a previously issued company safety alert was not 

followed. 

•  No procedures to be followed were available for the safe use of load binders. 
 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: To address this incident, this company issued the following directives: 
 
•  Company Equipment Standard for Ratchet Type Load Binders is to be issued replacing old style binders 

and to eliminate the hazard of binders springing open. 

•  All employees who use load binders should be given written procedures along with training relating to the 

proper use of this device.
