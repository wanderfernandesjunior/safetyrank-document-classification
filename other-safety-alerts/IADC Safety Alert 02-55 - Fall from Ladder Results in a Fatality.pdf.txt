Safety Alert 

From the International Association of Drilling Contractors

 

 
ALERT 02 – 55  
 

FALL FROM LADDER RESULTS IN A FATALITY 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
This  incident  occurred  outside  the  oil  and  gas  drilling  industry,  but  it  brings  to  light  an  often  forgotten  or 
overlooked hazard.  An employee was using a small, vertical ladder to climb to a platform in order to lubricate 
a machine.  He fell to the ground from a height of only 1.2m (4ft), striking the side of his head on the ground.  
He was found unconscious and taken to hospital, where he died. 
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
It is believed that he was holding a container of oil as he climbed, and therefore it is unlikely that he maintained 
three-point  contact  [two  hands  one  foot/two  feet  one  hand]  with  the  ladder.    Although  it  can  be  difficult  to 
believe,  falling  unexpectedly  from  relatively  small  heights  can  result  in  serious  injuries.    Carrying  an  oil  can 
prevented him from maintaining three-point contact on ladders that is critical to prevent falls.   
 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company instructed their personnel:   
 
•  Employees should always keep three point contact [two hands one foot/two feet one hand] when climbing 

ladders.   

•  When working at heights on all sites, follow company safety standard regarding working at heights.   
•  All employees are to be made aware of the hazard of not keeping three point contact: 
 
 

The Corrective Actions stated in this alert are one company’s attempts to address the incident, and do not 

necessarily reflect the position of IADC or the IADC HSE Committee.
