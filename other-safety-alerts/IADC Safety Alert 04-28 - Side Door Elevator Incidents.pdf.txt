ALERT 04 – 28 
 

SIDE DOOR ELEVATOR INCIDENTS 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
First incident:  Recently during casing pulling operations the side door elevator opened while laying out a joint of 7” casing 
with the crane.  This resulted in the joint dropping from the rig floor down against the gate of the V-Door and the leg of the 
pick-up & lay-down unit, coming to rest on the ground.  
 
Second  incident:  During  completion  tubular  running  operations  on  the  drill  floor,  the  side  door  elevators  opened  while 
picking  up  a  single  joint  out  of  the  mouse  hole.    The  elevators  opened  at  the  point  where  the  single  joint  was  almost 
completely out of the mouse hole.  The joint dropped across the floor and came to rest with the box end across the TDS 
frame and the pin stuck inside the top of the mouse hole.  Personnel were standing clear at this moment to enable the joint 
to travel towards the top of the completion already inside the hole.  Nobody was injured and the incident. 
 
Another  incident  was  reported  where  the  improper  placement  of  the  pin  was  caught  just  as  the  pipe  was  being  hoisted.  
The pipe was lowered and the elevators properly latched.  
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 

 
Failure by the rig crew to ensure that the latch was fully engaged prior to inserting the safety pin.  The safety pin was in the 
correct hole, however it had been installed at the wrong side of the latch handle (see picture 1)
