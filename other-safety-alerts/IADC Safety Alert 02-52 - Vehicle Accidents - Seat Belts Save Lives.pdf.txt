ALERT 02 – 52 
 

VEHICLE ACCIDENTS – SEAT BELTS SAVE LIVES 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
A Rig Manager on route to his home from the rig site encountered a deer and swerved to avoid striking the 
animal.  The vehicle struck the deer on the left side and then proceeded into the ditch.  When the driver 
attempted to correct the direction of travel, the corrective action caused the vehicle to roll over. The Rig 
Manager died as a result of this rollover.  
 
WHAT CAUSED IT:  
 
The  result  of  this  fatality  was  the  decision  of  the 
employee  to  NOT  wear  his  seat  belt,  causing  him  to 
not only be thrust outside of the vehicles "Engineered 
Life  Space"  during  the  roll  over,  but  also  crushed 
under the truck as it rolled over. 
 

WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
The driver “fell asleep” at the wheel while returning to 
the camp during the day.  The driver was wearing a 
seat belt and the injuries were very minor. 

WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
A crew was returning from rigging up on a lease and 
traveling  on  a  very  dusty  road  …visibility  was  poor.  
The  vehicle  slammed  into  a  tanker  truck  which  was 
slowing  down  to  make  a  turn  into  a  lease.    Both 
crewmembers  received  injuries.    Attending  police 
stated that if they hadn't been wearing their seat belts, 
they wouldn't be alive today.

•  SEAT  BELTS  SAVE  LIVES  -  WEAR  THEM!    "IF  WE'RE  ALL  WEARING  THEM, THEN,  WHY  DO  WE 

CONTINUE TO ATTEND FUNERALS?" 

•  SLOW DOWN TO DRIVING / ROAD CONDITIONS AND STAY ALERT ….. STAY ALIVE!
