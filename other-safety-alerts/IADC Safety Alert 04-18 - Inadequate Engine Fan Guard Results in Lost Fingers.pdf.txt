ALERT 04 – 18 
 

INADEQUATE ENGINE FAN GUARD RESULTS IN LOST FINGERS 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
Employee  bent  down  in  front  of  fan  on  diesel  engine.    He  was  using  a  rag  to  check  for  oil  leaks  on  hoses 
leading  to and  from  the  engine.   As  he  was  checking  he  felt a pull  on  the  rag.    The  fan caught  the rag  and 
pulled his fingers into the fan, thus removing fingers from his hand.  Employee severed first, middle, ring and 
small finger of the left hand to the second joint. 
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 

Inattention to loose rags and clothing.  

• 
•  Open section of fan shroud (fan shroud covered top 80% of fan)  
•  Engine not shut down and locked out.  

 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company issued the following directive: 
 
Fan guard will be retrofitted to cover the bottom sections as the units are returned from the field. Until that 
time, areas that are unguarded must be taped off and restricted access signs must be posted.  Discussion of 
proper lock out/tag out procedures must be discussed with employees.
