                 Safety Alert 14-18 

Don’t forget about Gangways and Ladders! 

Pilot dies in gangway accident. 

 
Recently,  a  vessel  pilot  died  while  boarding  a  vessel  when  its  gangway  separated  from  the  vessel, 
causing two persons to fall into the water.  Although the investigation is still underway and additional 
facts  are  being  gathered,  this  casualty  serves  as  another  reminder  that  shipboard  equipment  that 
seems quite benign can quickly become a hazard to persons boarding and departing a vessel. 

Commercial  vessels  can  present  hazards  to  mariners  onboard  if  the  risks  are  not  recognized  and 
mitigated.  Considering the hazards presented by rotating machinery, electrical systems, potential fire, 
severe weather, etc.; one could easily underappreciate the risk that a simple gangway presents, leading 
mariners  to  become  complacent.    Because  of  injuries  and  fatalities  on  gangways,  a  number  of 
organizations have developed gangway safety standards, requirements, and best practices.  

The    Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration  (OSHA)1,  International  Maritime  Organization2, 
Protection  and  Indemnity  Clubs,3  Owners  and  Operators4,  and  others5  have  put  forth  various 
requirements and shared best practices to improve gangway safety. 

Because of this recent fatality, the Coast Guard strongly recommends: 

•  Owners  and  Operators,  Captains  and  Mates  review  and  implement  the  best  practices  as 

presented in the links above and comply with all the regulations applicable to your vessel. 
 

•  For vessel pilots, crews, vendors, or anyone boarding or departing a vessel, condition yourself 
to take a moment to examine the gangway, accommodation or pilot ladder.  Look for potential 
hazards or deficiencies, and report them to senior personnel on board the vessel.  

At all times, if there is any question about the safety of a gangway, DO NOT CROSS IT. 
Do not assume that any gangway crossing is “routine.”
