Safety Alert 

        From the International Association of Drilling Contractors 

 
ALERT 06 – 42 
 

MAINTENANCE – TRAPPED PRESSURE 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
A  Subsea  Specialist  and  an  Assistant  Subsea  Specialist  were  transferring  nitrogen  from  one  cylinder  to 
another by taking nitrogen from partially filled cylinders to fill others.  The assistant had completed the job, 
and after closing the valves on the cylinders, bled the pressure off the line by breaking the connection with a 
wrench.    After  the  pressure  bled  down  and  he  began  removing  the  connection,  a  final  release  of  nitrogen 
suddenly occurred.  This startled the employee and caused him to jerk his head out of the way, striking the 
cylinder rack and chipping a tooth. 
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
•  The area was cluttered with items stored on the rig. 
•  The employee used a square duct blower as a work platform, which caused the employee’s face to be 

close to the cylinder rack. 

•  There was no JSA generated for this job. 
•  There was no pressure bleed-off valve on the line. 
•  The employee worked with unsafe equipment and under unsafe conditions while observed by at least 

one other team member.
