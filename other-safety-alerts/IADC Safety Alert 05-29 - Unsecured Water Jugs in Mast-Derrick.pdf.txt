ALERT 05 – 29 
 

UNSECURED WATER JUGS IN MAST/DERRICK 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
Two recent Near Miss Incidents have occurred concerning water jugs that turned into Dropped Objects. 
 
One  incident  was  caused  when  crew  members  attached  the  water  jug  to  the  elevator  horn  and  while  running  the 
elevators up to the monkey board, the jug slipped off and fell to the rig floor. Only by luck did it miss the crew members 
at floor level.  
 
The second incident resulted when the derrick man had taken a water jug to the monkey board and did not secure it to 
prevent the hazard of it falling. Activity on the board caused the jug to fall off and nearly miss crew members on the 
floor 
 
Both of these incidents must be considered serious. 

WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
•  Disregard for safe work practice and the hazard that was caused by this life threatening unsafe act. 
•  Company Job task analysis Principles were not followed. 
 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: To address this incident, this company did the following: 
 
•  A complete hazard review of this and other potential dropped objects from the mast should be performed on each 

rig. 
Supervisors should ensure that all unnecessary equipment in the mast/derrick should be removed. 

• 
•  The potential serious consequence of these two incidents should be discussed with crews in the next HSE meeting 

to raise awareness.
