Activated carbon drums were used in the vent system to control hydrocarbon emissions and odors. Each tank was to have a flame arrestor and a foam fire protection system, but they were not installed before filling the tanks. Suddenly, there was an explosion and a fire. Emergency response personnel arrived, residents living nearby were evacuated, and fire fighting and emergency control started. It took 3 days to put the fire out and deal with other issues such as contaminated fire water run off and spillage from other tanks.What Went Wrong?There are many causes of this accident, but let™s focus on the fire triangle.All three components of the ﬁFire Triangleﬂ (heat, fuel and oxygen) were present.Let™s see how that happened:ŁFuelFuelcame from the organic materials in the vessel vapor space;ŁOxygenOxygencame from the air in the vessel vapor space (the vessels were not nitrogen blanketed) and, Łthe only remaining component needed to start the fire was HeatHeat. Did it comefrom a loose electrical connection, static electricity, or hot work?

In fact, the carbon got so hot that it reached the autoignition temperature of the tank vent gas. That was theﬁsparkﬂ that led to this explosion!ŁA few autoignition temperatures you might want to know about:Łacetylene 305 oCŁn-butane 405 oCŁhydrogen 400 oCŁpropane 450 oCŁmethane 540 oCŁcarbon disulfide 90 oCOxygenHeatFuelNo! In this case, the vent system carbon No! In this case, the vent system carbon filters led to the explosion and fire.filters led to the explosion and fire.
