DROPPED OBJECT FROM DERRICK 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
The incident occurred when a stand of drill pipe missed the elevators, fell across the derrick towards the 
driller’s side and struck the derrick structure.  This impact dislodged a 2 foot x ¾ inch steel bar weighing 
approximately 3 pounds from the stabbing board ladder platform causing it to fall approximately 30 feet to the 
dog house below.  The steel bar struck and passed through the upper dog house window, narrowly missing 
the driller.  The window was constructed of shatter proof material but was not able to withstand the impact of 
the bar.

•  No formal derrick/dropped object inspection process was in place. 
•  No derrick log book was being used to monitor flow of tools up and down the derrick.
