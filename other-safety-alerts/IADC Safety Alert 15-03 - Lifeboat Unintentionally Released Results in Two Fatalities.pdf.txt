ALERT 15-03  

Lifeboat Unintentionally Released Results in Two Fatalities 

WHAT HAPPENED: 
An Assistant Electrician and Assistant Mechanic were inside a lifeboat performing weekly preventive maintenance while a Motorman 
was positioned on standby outside. When the work was thought to be completed, the hang off pendants were removed with the 
Assistant Electrician still onboard the lifeboat. The Assistant Mechanic re-entered the lifeboat to address an unfinished maintenance 
task. He proceeded to the engine compartment and asked the Assistant Electrician to function the lifeboat’s engine throttle. The 
Assistant Electrician instead pulled the lifeboat’s release lever, which resulted in the release of the lifeboat hooks and the lifeboat fell 
125 feet to the water. Both the Assistant Mechanic and Assistant Electrician perished from the lifeboat’s fall. 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
•  Assistant Mechanic and Assistant Electrician performed maintenance work without the hang off pendants attached. 
•  Motorman observed Assistant Mechanic re-enter the lifeboat without the hang off pendants attached and did not initiate Stop 

Work Authority. 

•  Assistant Electrician operated the lifeboat hook release lever after bypassing its safeguards. 
•  Assistant Electrician performed mechanical duties on lifeboat without adequate training.  
•  Permit Issuer incorrectly appointed Assistant Electrician to the Permit Authority role. 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company did the following: 
• 

The company will update its Totally Enclosed Motor Propelled Survival Craft Standard to require installation of standardized 
lifeboat warning signs for entering lifeboats, and to improve the lifeboat release mechanism labeling. 
The company will update its Emergency Drills and Exercises Offshore Standard to require all personnel to receive annual lifeboat 
familiarization training in addition to its existing program. 
The company will update its induction and orientation process to provide additional awareness on Stop Work Authority through 
videos and SWA drill participation. 
The company engineering group will review the adequacy of lifeboat release mechanism safety barriers. 
The company will review its preventive maintenance program to provide additional guidelines on the inspection of the lifeboat 
release mechanism. 
The company will review its lifeboat work instructions and ensure the following is included: 

•

hang off pendants with two locks. 
-Master, Chief Mate or Barge Supervisor must be assigned as Permit Authority over lifeboat work activities and must be
