        From the International Association of Drilling Contractors 

 
ALERT 11 – 28  
 

DROPPED OBJECT – CASING JOINT FALLS FROM ELEVATORS 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
While  picking  up  133/8  casing  through  the  V-door  using  single  door  elevator  with  crane  hooked  at  one  end 
(Pin end), at approximately 20 feet (6 meters) above the rotary table, the casing coupling disconnected from 
the joint allowing the casing joint to slide down the V-door to the catwalk where it subsequently fell onto the 
ground.  At approximately the same time the disconnected coupling dropped out the elevator to the rig floor.  
Luckily no injuries occurred. 
 

 

“Hand  Tight”  printed  on  the  coupling  of  a 
rejected casing joint. 

“Hand  Tight”  printed  on  the  backed  off  coupling 
joint.  

 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
  Coupling was not tightened correctly.  
  Coupling was stenciled “Loose coupling / Hand tight” was hard to read.  
  None of the rig personnel noticed the stenciling on the loose collar.   
 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company did the following: 
 
 

If loose couplers are found, segregate the joints and report to your supervisor. 

Instructed all supply personnel to immediately check for loose couplings on all casings available at sites. 
o 
Instructed rig personnel to ensure that all couplings on casings are checked prior to picking up to run into 
the well.
