Safety Alert 

        From the International Association of Drilling Contractors 

 
ALERT 07 – 19 
 

IMPROPER USE OF RETRACTABLE LIFE LINE 

RESULTS IN AN LTI 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
After latching a stand of drill collars into the elevators, the derrickman turned to prepare for another drill collar 
stand to be picked up.  The cable from his working retractable life line snagged the inspection door of the 
traveling blocks.  As the blocks were traveling down, the snagged cable pulled on the derrickman's harness 
forcing him to squat on the monkey board.  The derrickman's left leg went between the fingers in the monkey 
board, and the pressure of the blocks going down broke his ankle.  
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 

• 

Incorrect use of fall protection - Derrickman was attached to the fall arrest for the derrick ladder instead 

of the monkey board working fall arrest line.  

•  Derrickman turned his back to the blocks while the blocks were traveling past him.  
 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company did the following: 

•  Existing Job Safety Analysis (JSA) rewritten, fully addressing hazards of working in the derrick.  

•  Derrickman hookup procedure rewritten to include requirement to use platform fall arrest and the driller 

will not move blocks until this is confirmed.  

•  Safety meeting held with rig to discuss importance of using correct equipment for the task at hand.  

•  Alert sent out to all rigs and industry.  
 

The Corrective Actions stated in this alert are one company’s attempts to address the incident,  

and do not necessarily reflect the position of IADC or the IADC HSE Committee.
