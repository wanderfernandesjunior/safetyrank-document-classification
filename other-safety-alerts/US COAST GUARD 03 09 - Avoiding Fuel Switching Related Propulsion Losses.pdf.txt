Avoiding propulsion loss from fuel switching:  

American Petroleum Institute Technical Considerations 

 

Ships  switch  fuel  oil  from  residual  fuels  to  distillate  fuels  in  order  to  reduce  emissions.    The  Coast 
Guard  expects  ships  will  switch  fuel  more  frequently  to  comply  with  new  emission  reduction 
regulations.    When  switching  fuel  oil,  some  ships  have  experienced  propulsion  losses  linked  to 
procedural errors or fuel oil incompatibility.  
 
API  developed  a  paper  titled  “Technical  Considerations  of  Fuel  Switching  Practices”  that  discusses 
problems 
is  available  at 
http://marineinvestigations.us  >Safety  Reports.  This  document  may  be  useful  to  vessel  owners, 
operators, and engineers interested in preventing fuel system failures and propulsion casualties while 
meeting current and future exhaust emission control requirements. 
 
In  order  to  prevent  casualties  associated  with  fuel  oil  switching,  the  Coast  Guard  strongly 
recommends that owner and operators:

•  Consult engine and boiler manufacturers for fuel switching guidance; 
•  Consult fuel suppliers for proper fuel selection;  
•  Exercise tight control when possible over the quality of the fuel oils received; 
•  Consult manufacturers to determine if system modifications or additional safeguards are 

necessary for intended fuels; 

•  Develop detailed fuel switching procedures;  
•  Establish a fuel system inspection and maintenance schedule; 
•  Ensure system pressure and temperature alarms, flow indicators, filter differential pressure 

transmitters, etc.., are all operational; 

•  Ensure system purifiers, filters and strainers are maintained; 
•  Ensure system seals, gaskets, flanges, fittings, brackets and supports are maintained; 
•  Ensure a detailed system diagram is available; 
•  Conduct initial and periodic crew training; 
•  Complete fuel switching well offshore prior to entering restricted waters or traffic lanes.
