UNSAFE HABITS ENDANGER ALL WHO WORK AT SEA 

What causes the most common shipboard accidents? Unsafe working habits, for the most part. Try 
this checklist of possible causes for accidents, and see if any of them apply to you:  

•  Do you fail to look where you walk on ship, when on and off duty?  

•  Do you let your hands and feet remain in unsafe positions, such as door frames or open hatch 

covers?  
 

produce hernia?  
 

•  Do you lift or handle material with poor body posture, certain in time to pull a muscle or 

•  When you climb or descend steps on board, do you forget to use hand rails? Do you also 

neglect to watch to see if grease or water has made the treads slippery?  
 

•  Do you use defective tools? Wrenches with spread jams, pliers with worn teeth, chipped ends 

of screwdrivers and loose hammerheads are examples of defective tools that can fail in use 
and cause injuries to the user.  
 

•  Do you use your hands instead of hand tools, thinking to save time and effort?  

•  Do you use the wrong tool for a job, hoping to make do or cut corners?  

•  Do you work too fast for safety, under the prevailing conditions of the job?  

•  Do you forget to wear personal protective equipment—gloves, goggles, helmet, supporters, 

safety shoes?  
 

•  Do you wear improper clothes while working, such as scarves, ties or long sleeves that could 
become caught in machinery? If you have to work in a hot, constricted area, do you wear too 
little to protect you in case of an accident?
