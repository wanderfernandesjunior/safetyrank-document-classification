ALERT 04 – 09 
 

LOWERING BELL NIPPLE RESULTS IN A FATALITY 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
While slacking off the Bell Nipple in cellar area, the Bell Nipple pulled down the flow-line on top of the crewman 
working in cellar.  The injuries sustained by the crewman were fatal.   
 
Equipment involved:  Two air-hoists, flow-line trough - not connected to bell-nipple with dresser sleeve, but 
suspended below bell-nipple outlet with chains. 
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
An employee was working under a load as it was being lowered into position.   
 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company recommended the following: 
 
1)  For all flow-lines, make certain that there is a back up system, such as pad-eyes connected by shackles, 
turnbuckles or certified slings.  Chains should be avoided as a back-up system.  These back-ups should 
connect the flow-line to the substructure.  

 
2)  Ensure that the flow-line is removed prior to raising or lowering bell-nipple:  
 

•  At dresser-sleeve if it is a pipe-to-pipe connection.  
•  Move flow-line trough away from bell-nipple if it is a trough type system.  

 
3)  Review the basics of lifting and handling loads.  
 
4)  Stress staying out from under loads at all times. 

The Corrective Actions stated in this alert are one company’s attempts to address the incident, and do not 

necessarily reflect the position of IADC or the IADC HSE Committee.
