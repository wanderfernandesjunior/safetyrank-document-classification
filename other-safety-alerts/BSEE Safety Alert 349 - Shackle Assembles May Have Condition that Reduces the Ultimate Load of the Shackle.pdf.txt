 Shackle Assembles May Have Condition that Reduces  

the Ultimate Load of the Shackle 

 

Stamped identification codes in the areas indicated by the red circles will help identify the shackles affected by this Safety Alert. 
The photograph to the far right, of a shackle with a pen, is shown for scale. 

 

Although there have been no apparent field failures or customer complaints, the Crosby 
Group (Crosby) recently issued an “Important Safety Notice” for the following shackles: 

 

1018375 1/2t G-209  
1018384 1/2t S-209  
1018017 1/2t G-213  
1018026 1/2t S-213  
1019466 1/2t G-2130 

 
The affected shackles have the following production identification codes stamped in 
the areas shown by the red circles in the photographs - TSC, TSD, TSE, TUB, TUC, 
TUD and TUE. 
 
Crosby determined that there is a possibility a small percentage of the 1/2t G/S-209, G/S-
213 and G-2130 shackle assemblies may have a condition that reduces the ultimate load 
of  the  shackle.  Specifically,  Crosby  indicated  that  a  small  percentage  of  these  products 
may not reach the company’s targeted 6x design factor (six times the rated working load 
limit). 
 
Crosby announced that using the shackles within the rated working load limit is acceptable, 
but use in excess of the rated working load limit may result in property damage, severe 
injury, or death.  
 
 

Therefore, BSEE recommends that operators consider the following: 
 

•  Conduct a hazard hunt or search of current inventory to identify and 

locate any of the affected shackles either in stock or in use. 

 
•  Take immediate action to quarantine the affected shackles and contact 

Crosby Group customer service (sales.support@thecrosbygroup.com or 1-
800-772-1500).   

Inform all personnel involved with rigging or lifting, including shore-based 
dock services, that they should not utilize the equipment covered by this 
Safety Alert beyond the rated load limit.

circumstances surrounding a potential safety issue. It also contains recommendations 
that could assist avoiding potential incidents on the Outer Continental Shelf.
