Recent Safety Notices on Deficient Harnesses and Gloves 

 Defective DBI-SALA® ExoFit NEXTM Harness 

  Potentially Toxic NF11 / NF11X Series Gloves 

During  April  2019,  two  separate  safety  notices  were  released  by  Original  Equipment 
Manufacturers  (OEMs)  to  applicable  companies  for  the  inspection  and  replacement  of 
particular harnesses and gloves commonly used in many industries, including offshore oil 
and gas operations on the Outer Continental Shelf. An overview of each safety notice is 
outlined below: 

1. 3MTM Fall Protection

The  dorsal  d-ring  used  in  the  DBI-SALA®  ExoFit  NEXTM  harness  with  the  lot 
number code “09P1” has been identified as defective if manufactured between 
January 2016 and December 2018. Please note that both the manufactured date 
range on the harness label and the lot number code “09P1” stamped on the d-
ring must be present to properly identify it as defective. 

2. Honeywell Gloves

The red NF11 and NF11X gloves have been identified as potentially harmful if 
received from the manufacturer before January 1, 2019 due to the presence of 
trace levels of Benzidine in the red dye. This determination was made as a result 
of a recent certification testing and regulatory review of the product. All gloves 
received from the manufacturer after January 1, 2019 are free of dyes that could 
potentially release Benzidine. 

Based on the issuance of the two safety notices outlined above, BSEE recommends 
that operators consider the following: 
 

•  Conduct a hazard hunt or search of current inventory to identify and locate any of 

the affected equipment either in stock or in use. 

•  Use proper Personal Protective Equipment (i.e., gloves and safety glasses) when 

removing the affected gloves to avoid potential exposure. 

•  Contact the relevant OEMs for additional instructions regarding the necessary 

course of action: 
 

o  3MTM Fall Protection - contact 3M Customer Service at (833) 638-2697 or at 

3musfpserviceaction@mmm.com 
 

o  Honeywell Gloves – contact Honeywell Customer Service at (877) 841-2840. 
Honeywell is using a third party contractor, Stericycle, to aid in the collection 
of the product. Stericycle can be contacted at (888) 462-0579.

A Safety Alert is a tool used by BSEE to inform the offshore oil and gas industry of the 
circumstances surrounding a potential safety issue. It also contains recommendations 
that could assist avoiding potential incidents on the Outer Continental Shelf.
