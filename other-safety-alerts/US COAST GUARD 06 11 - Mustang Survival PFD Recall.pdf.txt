The  United  States  Coast  Guard  strongly  urges  mariners and  boaters alike  to  check  their  Mustang

This recall is being issued for the inspection and repair of an inflator installation inconsistency that 
may prevent some units from fully inflating with CO2 (oral inflation functions normally).  Mustang 
Survival has developed a solution that corrects any affected product and prevents re-occurrence of 
this issue.  The inspection and repair can only be performed at a Mustang Survival factory.
