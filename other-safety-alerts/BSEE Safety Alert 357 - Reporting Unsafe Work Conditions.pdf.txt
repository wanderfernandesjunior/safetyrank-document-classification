Required Posting of Signs regarding  

the Reporting of Unsafe Work Conditions 

                                 

Sign that fulfills requirement of 30 CFR 250.1933 

 

During recent inspections, BSEE personnel identified multiple signs required by  
30 CFR 250.1933(b) that were either non-existent or contained inaccurate information.  
 
30 CFR 250.1933(b) details the posting requirements for the reporting information 
specified in 30 CFR 250.193(e)(2). In accordance with these regulations, all facilities on 
the Outer Continental Shelf must have a notice at the place of employment in a visible 
location frequently visited by personnel that contains the following information:   
 
To report hazardous or unsafe working conditions or a possible violation contact 
BSEE by: 
 

•  Phone at 1-877-440-0173 (BSEE Toll-free Safety Hotline), 
• 
•  Mail to: U.S. DOI/BSEE, 1849 C Street NW., Mail Stop 5438, Washington, DC

In some instances, BSEE identified signs that prioritized operator or contractor contact 
information over BSEE. Although these signs meet the minimum requirements of the 
regulation, they do not accurately convey the intent of the regulation, because they can 
be construed as influencing personnel in favor of contacting the operator or contractor. 
The BSEE contact information is the primary avenue for reporting unsafe working 
conditions. 
 
Therefore, BSEE recommends that operators consider the following: 
 

•  Verify all “Reporting of Unsafe Work Conditions” signs on offshore facilities are in 

compliance with 30 CFR 250.1933 and located in a visible location frequently 
visited by personnel; 

•  Ensure all information on notices is accurate per 30 CFR 250.193. To assist 

personnel with internet access, BSEE suggests you post the longer version of the 
pertinent internet location, https://www.bsee.gov/resources-tools/incident-reporting; 

•  Clearly distinguish BSEE contact information from the contact information provided 

by an operator representative or its independent third party; 

•  Notify all personnel of procedures to report unsafe working conditions in 

accordance with 30 CFR 250.193; and, 

•  Encourage personnel to sign up for BSEE!Safe to receive Safety Alert and 

Bulletins directly via text message. To sign up, personnel should visit:
