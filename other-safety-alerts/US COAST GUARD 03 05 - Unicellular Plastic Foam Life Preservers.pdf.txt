Washington, DC 
 
Non-Serviceable and Substandard Type I Unicellular Plastic Foam Life Preservers 
 
Recently  during  several  annual  inspections  of  small  passenger  vessels,  Coast  Guard  Marine 
Inspectors  discovered  a  number  of  problems  with  Personal  Flotation  Devices  (PFDs)  manufactured 
by  Atlantic-Pacific  Manufacturing  Co.  (APCO).    APCO  formerly  produced  various  types  of  PFDs 
including  several  sizes  of  unicellular  plastic  foam  life  preservers  and  is  currently  out  of  business.  
PFDs from other manufacturers could have similar problems. 
 
A close inspection revealed –  
 

•  varying body strap lengths, sometimes less than 54” from the tip of the snap hook to the tip of 

the D-ring, resulting in  a very tight fitting adult sized PFD on average sized crewmember, 

•  non-resilient and brittle condition of the PFD flotation foam, 
•  differences in foam volumes and physical size for the same model of PFD and, 
• 

inaccurate markings, incorrect Q-spec numbers (106.055 vs. 160.055), misspelled words, and 
incorrect narratives. 

 
Additionally, follow-up buoyancy tests of suspect PFDs performed by the Marine Inspectors resulted 
in  numerous  failures.  All  PFDS  that  had  failed  were  condemned  and  each  exhibited  noticeable 
shrinkage and compression.  Many of these PFDs have been in use since the 1970’s and may have 
reached the end of their service life.

The US Coast Guard strongly recommends that owners and operators carefully inspect all of their 
older Type I unicellular plastic foam PFDs.  Potential indications that a Type I unicellular plastic foam 
PFD may no longer be serviceable are: 
 

1.  Compression: The PFD may be compressed from many years of stowage. 

 

2.  Loss of resiliency: The PFD is excessively hard, stiff or its foam is brittle.  Normally after 

compressing the PFD to about half its initial thickness, the foam should expand to its original 
dimension in a short period of time. 
 

3.  Shrinkage: A physical reduction in size may be indicated by “wrinkling” of the coating on vinyl-

dipped type or by a loose fitting shell on a fabric-covered PFD. 
 

4.  Manufacturer:  While the potential for problems applies to all older PFDs, those manufactured 
by Atlantic-Pacific Manufacturing Corporation (APCO) have been specifically noted. Approval 
numbers for APCO PFDs are: 

160.055/54/1  
                    Adult Model 8130 
160.055/111/0                             Adult Model 8150 
160.055/112/1                             Child Model 81510 
160.055/121/0                             Adult Model 81407 LOT # 73 
160.055/122/0                             Child Model 81410 or 81413
