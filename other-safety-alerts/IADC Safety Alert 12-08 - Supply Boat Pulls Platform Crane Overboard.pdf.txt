ALERT 12 – 08  
 

SUPPLY BOAT PULLS PLATFORM CRANE OVERBOARD 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
During routine lifting operations on a production platform, which involved offloading a 20 foot basket from a 
supply boat, the basket turned around when the crane started lifting it and hooked inside an escape opening 
in  the  rail.    The  supply  boat  moved  down  on  the  swell  at  the  same  time  as  the  crane  lifted.    The  crane 
operator  lowered  the  lift  back  on  the  deck  and  tried  to  lift  it  again.  The  basket  hooked  inside  the  opening, 
seconds later the crane fell in to the sea.  The crane-operator managed to escape without injuries. 
 
The vessel was still connected to the crane (now on the sea bed) as the hook and wire from the crane were 
connected to the cargo and hanging out over the stern of the vessel.  Later the crane wire broke.  Because of 
the potential risk to the vessel’s crew members, the crane wire was not cut by the vessel’s deck crew.  The 
basket remained on the supply boat deck. As a result of the crane falling into the sea, a small oil spill was 
reported (0.6ltr).  This incident is considered a high risk incident and relevant investigations have started up.
