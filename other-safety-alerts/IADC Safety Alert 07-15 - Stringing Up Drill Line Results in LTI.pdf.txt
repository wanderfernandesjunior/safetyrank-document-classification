Safety Alert 

        From the International Association of Drilling Contractors 

 
ALERT 07 – 15 
 

STRINGING UP DRILL LINE RESULTS IN LTI 

 

WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
While stringing the drill line on a new rig, the injured party (IP) was ‘pulling’ or ‘guiding’ the deadline between 
two crown sheaves.  At that time, the IP’s fingers on his right hand got caught between the deadline and the 
keeper guard.  The result was the amputation of two finger tips on his right hand.  
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
A safety meeting was held prior to doing this job.  A JSA was conducted to properly identify the hazards and 
risk-reducing methods.  However, it became apparent that all known hazards were not fully identified by the 
IP.  The IP was doing a job that did not need performing.  The drill line string did not need to be manually 
pulled as it was being fed mechanically.  The decision of the injured Supervisor to place his right hand in that 
position was both tragic and unnecessary. 
 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company instructed Rig Supervisors’ in the 
following: 
 
•  Better planning of critical tasks is required by Leadership. 
•  A  thorough  JSA  must  be  conducted  with  all  Rig  Supervision  and  personnel  involved  in  the  job  being 

performed. 

 
 

 
 

 

The Corrective Actions stated in this alert are one company’s attempts to address the incident,
