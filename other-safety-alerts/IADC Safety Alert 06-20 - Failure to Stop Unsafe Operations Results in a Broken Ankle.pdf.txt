Safety Alert 

        From the International Association of Drilling Contractors 

 
ALERT 06 – 20 
 

FAILURE TO STOP UNSAFE OPERATONS RESULTS 

IN A BROKEN ANKLE 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
An employee was helping to rig down a third party operation at the rig.  The employee felt it was necessary 
to  stand  on  the  catwalk  while  preparing  the  equipment  for  off  –  loading.    A  15  foot  section  of  pipe  was 
hanging in the V-door and the bottom was on the catwalk.  Somehow the end of the pipe slipped off of the 
edge of the catwalk, knocking the employee off the catwalk and breaking his ankle. 
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
The air hoist operator saw the employee on the catwalk but did not warn that employee off.  It turns out the 
injured man was a new employee and was not aware of the policy of never standing on the catwalk while 
lifting or lowering equipment. 
 
He knows it now – the hard way. 
 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company did the following: 
 
 
Instructed rig personnel to: 
 
Use the company stop work policy when you 
notice an accident in the making like this.  The 
right thing for the air hoist operator do is to refuse 
to operate the air hoist until the employee gets off 
of the catwalk. 
 
STOP those unsafe operations!
