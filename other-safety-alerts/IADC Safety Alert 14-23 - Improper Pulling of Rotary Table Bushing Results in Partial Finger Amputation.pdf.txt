Safety Alert 

        From the International Association of Drilling Contractors 

 
ALERT 14 – 23 
 

IMPROPER PULLING OF ROTARY TABLE BUSHING RESULTS IN PARTIAL 

FINGER AMPUTATION 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
The crew was in the process of pulling the rotary bushing using the bushing puller that was attached to the 
winch line. The two bushing puller hooks were each attached to a bushing half.  When the rotating bushing 
halves "popped free", one half of the bushing swung toward the console.  An employee attempted to catch 
the  bushing  with  his  left  hand.    As  the  bushing  half  made  contact  with  his  hand,  the  momentum  of  the 
bushing pushed his hand into the derrick thereby partially amputating his left ring finger.  In this case, proper 
PPE was not in question. 
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 

•  The  bushing  puller  is  designed  and  intended  to  pull  one  half  of  the  bushing  at  a  time.    The  crew  was 

thinking they would save time by pulling both halves at once.   

•  A JSA was not performed prior to this task 
 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company did the following: 
 

•  The company reminded all employees to always take the time to talk over the hazards and actions prior 

to the operation (conduct a JSA). 

•  The company instructed all employees in the rig fleet to use all tools as intended and don't cut corners. 
•  The company reminded all employees to never try to catch or stop falling or swinging iron. 
 

The Corrective Actions stated in this alert are one company’s attempts to address the incident,  

and do not necessarily reflect the position of IADC or the IADC HSE Committee.
