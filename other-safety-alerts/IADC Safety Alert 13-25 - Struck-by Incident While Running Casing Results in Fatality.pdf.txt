ALERT 13 – 25 
 

STRUCK-BY INCIDENT WHILE RUNNING CASING RESULTS IN FATALITY 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
While  running  casing,  an  employee  (Injured  Person  –  IP)  was  backing  out  a  cross  threaded  18-5/8  inch 
(46cm) casing joint when he was struck on the right side of his head by the casing power tong.  This impact 
caused his head to hit against the top drive rail lifting eye and then he fell 3 feet (91cm) down to the rig floor. 
 
 

 
 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 

 

•  The IP was the normal operator of the Casing Pickup Machine but had temporarily replaced the Casing 

Tong Operator, who left the Rig Floor to make a phone call. 

•  The IP was not trained to operate the casing power tong. 
•  The IP was in the incorrect position when he operated the casing power tong. 
•  The IP operated the tong in high speed low torque to disconnect the casing joint. 
•  A  generic  Job  Safety  Analysis  (JSA)  was  used  that  was  not  specific  to  the  task  of  running  the  18-5/8” 

(46cm) casing. 

•  The snub line was hooked-up in the incorrect position. 
•  There was a lack of supervision as the Supervisor had left the rig floor just before the incident happened. 
 

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company did the following: 
 
•  The company reminded all Drilling Contractors and Service Parties that ONLY trained/certified operators 

are to be allowed to perform specific critical jobs such as Running Casing, Cementing, Man Riding, 
Critical Lifts, etc. 

•  All crews were reminded that a job-specific JSA is required for the specific task so as to correctly identify 

the hazards of the job. 

•  Supervisors were instructed to ensure that the operators understand and comply with the JSA. 

The Corrective Actions stated in this alert are one company’s attempts to address the incident,  

and do not necessarily reflect the position of IADC or the IADC HSE Committee.
