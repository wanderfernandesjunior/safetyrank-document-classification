The Coast Guard has become aware of certain Mustang Survival Inflatable PFDs with Hammar MA1 
hydrostatic  (HIT)  inflation  systems  which  may  not  inflate  and  require  a  new  re-arm  kit  to  properly 
inflate  by  manual  or  automatic  activation.    This  safety  alert  identifies  which  products  are  affected. 
Certain  inflatable  PDFs  may  be  subject  to  delayed  or  non-inflations.    To  determine  if  you  are 
impacted please follow the instructions below.

If you have a re-arm kit MA7214 or MA7218 you need only to check 
the  lot  number  on  the  CO2  cylinder  label.    If  your  CO2  cylinder  is 
marked with lot numbers 404121 or 404122 please contact Mustang 
Survival’s customer service group at the number below. 
 
If you have a PFD listed above refer to the sewn-in approval label to 
determine if it was “Made in Canada” and the “MFG DATE” is April 
or  May  2012.    If  so,  you  will  need  to  check  the  lot  numbers  of  the 
CO2  cylinder.  The  CO2  cylinder  lot  number  is  visible  through  the 
yellow  bladder  fabric.  Manually  unpack  your  PFD  by  opening  the 
zippers  and  unfolding  your  PFD.  Find  the  CO2  cylinder  that  is 
attached  to  the  round  inflator  within  the  yellow  bladder.    Press  the 
yellow  bladder  fabric  against  the  cylinder  to  read  the  label  to  view 
the  lot  number  through  the  fabric.  If  your  CO2  cylinder  is  marked 
with  lot  numbers  404121  or  404122,  please  contact  Mustang 
Survival’s customer service group for instructions and to arrange for 
a replacement inflator assembly.  
 
All other CO2 cylinder lot numbers are satisfactory.  Repack your PFD so it is ready for use per the 
instruction manual.   Mustang Survival Customer Service Group: 1-800-526-0532
