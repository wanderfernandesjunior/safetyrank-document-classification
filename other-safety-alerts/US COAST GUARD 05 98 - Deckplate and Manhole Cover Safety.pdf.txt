      Safety Alert 05-98 
 

DECKPLATE AND MANHOLE COVER SAFETY 

1.  If you remove a deck plate or manhole cover anywhere on board ship, warn other personnel 

2.  If you must leave the "opening" try to place a guard over it; perhaps a saw-horse or a step-

that it is off.  
 

stool, etc. If possible, rope off the area.  
 

3.  Never leave such covers off longer than necessary.  

 

4.  When lifting these covers take a good stance, a firm grip, and lift with your leg muscles, rather 

than with your back. Once it is off, be careful where you set it aside; don't make it a tripping 
hazard for another person.  
 

5.  If a deck plate or manhole cover is out of position at time of changing watch, be sure to warn 

the new watch.  
 

6.  If a deck plate or manhole cover is removed, it is often for some job being done under the 

deck, in a hold or tank. In this situation a standby man must be positioned at the opening at all 
times; he will warn others of the danger and keep in contact with the man under deck for his 
safety.
