Safety Alert 

        From the International Association of Drilling Contractors 

 
ALERT 10 – 29  
 

NEAR MISS – DROPPED TONG WEIGHT 

 

WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
After changing out the rig floor drill pipe tongs, a rig crew member went up the derrick to remove weight from 
the tong counter-balance weight bucket.  He removed two steel weights and tied them to the rig floor winch 
line with sash cord.  While lowering the weight to the floor, the sash cord broke, allowing the weights to fall 
60 feet to the rig floor. 

WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
  Personnel didn’t see the hazard of using sash cord to lower the weights rather than an approved lifting 

device such as a cable or basket.   

  The hazard (dropping the weights) was realized and discussed in the pre-job safety meeting so the rig 
floor was kept clear of personnel during the entire process but the rig crew did not recognize the need for 
using a proper lifting device.   

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company did the following: 
 
 

Instructed rig personnel that the pre-job safety meeting should be used to spot all the hazards of doing 
tasks.   
Instructed rig personnel to look at each phase of the job to ensure that all hazards are identified.  
Instructed rig personnel that only approved lifting devices should be used when hoisting or lowering all 
types of equipment.
