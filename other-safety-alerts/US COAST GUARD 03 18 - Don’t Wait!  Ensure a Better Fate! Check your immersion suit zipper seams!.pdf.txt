Don’t Wait!  Ensure a Better Fate! 
 Check your immersion suit zipper seams 

 
During  a  recent  inspection,  U.S.  Coast  Guard  Port  State  Control  examiners  discovered  a  significant  flaw 
involving almost all of a vessel’s immersion suits.  The examiners noted that the glue used to attach the main 
zipper to the body of the suit had failed.  Failure of the suit at this location will prevent the suit from achieving 
a watertight seal.  Such conditions present serious risk to crewmembers in a survival situation.  
 
Due to the high failure rate discovered during the Coast Guard exam (35 out of 40 suits were defective), the 
Coast Guard strongly recommends that vessel operators inspect their Immersion Suits for this potential 
unsafe  condition.    Do  not  wait  to  discover  the  problem  during  a  real  emergency.    As  a  reminder,  any 
replacement survival suits need to be approved by the vessel’s Flag State.
