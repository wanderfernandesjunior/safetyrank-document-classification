 

LESSONS LEARNED 

 
These  “Lessons  Learned”  are  alerts  and  bulletins  usually  received  from  sources  outside  the 
Company that are not normally documented alerts in the GEMS System.  These may or may not 
relate to your operation, and are provided for information purposes only, but should be posted 
for everyone’s use. In those cases where it may be deemed that a rig in our fleet may encounter 
similar circumstances, a list of action items for everyone to address will be included for addition 
to CAPA.

Mud/Gas Separator Cleaning Results in Death 
 
 
 
BSEE has issued Safety Bulletin No.003 as a result of a 10 March 2016 fatal incident during 
cleaning of a Mud/Gas separator. BSEE also provided the Panel Report on the Incident as well as 
the Acting Director’s memo on review of the Panel Report. The fatal accident occurred when an 
Assistant Driller (AD) placed his head and an arm into a platform drilling rig’s vertical Mud/Gas 
Separator (MGS) through its inspection hatch, while performing the assigned, but non-routine 
task of removing built up and hardened material from inside the MGS.
