ALERT 15-06 
  

CAUGHT BETWEEN WINCH TRUCK & HALF PIT 

 

WHAT HAPPENED:   
 
During rig up operations a third party/sub-contractor trucking company arrived on location in two separate winch trucks 
each  pulling  a  flatbed  trailer  and  hauling  a  half  pit.  The  first  truck  unloaded  the  first  half  pit  successfully  and  without 
incident  on  the  edge  of  location.  As  the  second  half  pit  was  unloaded  the  injured  person  (IP)  was  assisting  his  crew 
members  when  he stepped  between  the  trailer  tailboard  roller  and  half  pit  and  was caught  between  the  two  where  he 
sustained his injuries. 
 
As the truck was positioned for the half pit to be unloaded a forklift owned and operated by another trucking company 
was used to push the half pit off of the trailer until the half pit/load broke over the trailer tailboard.  Once the half pit was 
on  the  ground  the  truck  driver  pulled  completely  out  from  under  the  load  and  proceeded to  slack  off  on  the  winch  (all 
standard procedure to this point). As the driver started to pull forward releasing the winch to provide slack and remove 
the bridal line from the half pits load hitches the injured person signaled to the driver to stop after only pulling forward less 
than two feet. At that time the swamper’s removed the bridal line and threw the bridal line up on the trailer across the 
tailboard pins. 
 
The IP then squeezed himself between the trailer tailboard roller and half pit trying to get to the driver side to release the 
airbag controls. At the same time, the driver had the truck in neutral with one foot on the truck brakes and one on the 
clutch so he could engage the winch and tighten up the winch line.  While the driver was looking down to engage the 
PTO, the truck rolled back (presumably because the driver let his foot off the brake) and ultimately pinned the IP between 
the trailer tailboard roller and the half pit. Both the injured person and the other swamper started to yell for the driver to 
pull  forward.  As  the  truck  pulled  forward  the  swamper  stepped  in  to  hold  the  injured  person  up  and  yelled  for  help. 
Additional help immediately arrived and assisted to lay the IP on the ground. Basic first aid treatment was provided while 
waiting on the ambulance to arrive. 
 
WHAT CAUSED IT:   
 

- 

The injured person stepped between the trailer tailboard roller and half pit putting him in a known pinch point 
and did not follow the standard procedure for the task. 
Lack of communication, both verbal and visual. 
Stop work authority was not utilized. 

- 
- 
-  Complacency.  No pre job JSA or last minute risk assessment was used prior to the task. 

 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company did the following: 
 

All personnel involved must agree and understand the necessary steps to be taken to complete a task safely. 
Known hazards of the task and how to mitigate those hazards shall be followed. The injured person was aware 
of the hazard but chose to ignore it and take a short cut to complete 

              his task. Following the standard order of operations and calling for a “STOP THE JOB” when the 
              plan deviates away from or out of order is a requirement and shall be followed by all personnel. 

The personnel involved in such tasks shall remain in constant communication both verbal and visual.  The truck 
driver did not verify that his swamper’s were clear and at a safe distance from the truck as he prepared to pull 
away from the load. 
The other swamper involved in the task did not stop the job as he witnessed his crew member taking a known 
short cut and putting himself in a known hazard. 

-  No matter how routine or repetitive a task may seem having a plan and working the plan is essential. Discuss 

the plan and protect yourself from the known hazards.
