Safety Alert 

        From the International Association of Drilling Contractors 

EMPLOYEE’S FINGER AMPUTATED 

 
ALERT 15-02  
 

WHAT HAPPENED: 

 

 

The injured employee was in the process of unlocking the BOP ram in order to open the ram with a 
hydraulic system that was spotted 50 feet away from the BOP. The employee decided to place his 
finger into the OEM sight opening slot to make sure the locking screw was completely out.  The crew 
chief  engaged  the  ram  control  valve  while  employee’s  finger  was  still  in  the  slot  resulting  in  an 
amputation of the employee's left index finger. 

WHAT CAUSED IT:  

The employee was able to place the finger thru the OEM sight opening on BOP 
ram  shaft  bonnet.    The  control  system  was  not  isolated,  locked  out  or  tagged  out  while  the  IP  placed  his 
finger  inside.    There  was  no  apparent  understanding  or  communication  between  the  IP  and  the  remote 
operator. 
 

 

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: To address this incident, this company did the following:   

A temporary guard was manufactured and placed over the BOP ram shaft bonnet.   The guard will be bolted 
using the original screw holes on BOP to avoid employees placing their fingers into the shaft compartment.  
Equipment should be isolated from remote or third party operation before being worked on.  Additionally, a 
thorough JSA should be conducted prior to start to identify hazards and establish communication.
