Fire in Smoking Area Linked to Cigarette Butt Container 

Damaged Freezer after fire. 

Damaged Trash Can and Cigarette Butt Container 

              

        

    

 

Recently, personnel on an offshore platform, smelled smoke and exited their quarters to 
find  a  small  unplugged  freezer  in  the  smoking  area  engulfed  in  flames.  Personnel 
extinguished  the  fire  using  fire  extinguishers  and  doused  all  smoldering  areas  until  the 
situation  was  brought  under  full  control.  It  was  determined  that  a  plastic  cigarette  butt 
container had ignited, and the resulting flame spread to the freezer, another cigarette butt 
container, a plastic trash can, and the plywood support upon which all were located.  The 
original butt container from which the fire emanated was completely consumed by the fire.  

Although  exact  details  about  the  ignition  source  remain  unknown,  the  operator’s 
investigation determined it was possible that a hot cigarette in an overfilled butt container 
ignited the other butts and the container before spreading and burning for as long as 20 
minutes.  

Therefore, BSEE recommends that Operators: 

•  Ensure all cigarette butt containers are not in the vicinity of combustible items. 

•  Create and enforce a policy for periodically emptying each cigarette butt container to 

avoid overfilling and the resultant fire hazard. 

•  Place every cigarette butt container on a noncombustible surface.

A Safety Alert is a tool used by BSEE to inform the offshore oil and gas industry of the 
circumstances surrounding a potential safety issue. It also contains recommendations 
that could assist avoiding potential incidents on the Outer Continental Shelf.
