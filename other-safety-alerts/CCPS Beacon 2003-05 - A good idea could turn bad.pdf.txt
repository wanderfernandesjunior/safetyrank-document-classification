WHENYOUIGNOREMANAGEMENTOFCHANGE!Here™s What Happened:A mechanic was draining oil from this large gear box. The oil was draining out veryslowly, so he decided to speed the job up by connecting an air hose to push the oil out faster. It didn™t take long for the results shown to happen. The cast iron gear box fractured, blowing a large piece off and onto the floor. Fortunately, no one was hurt.Why Did This Happen?ŁThe gear box was not a pressure vesselŁMore air was added than could be vented, so the pressure built upŁMOC was not used to review the change What Can You Do?ŁMany pieces of equipment in a chemical plant are NOT designed for pressure. Check the equipment folder, but if there is no ASME code stamp, assume that it is not pressure rated.ŁAdding air to the gear box was a change and should have been checked through the site™s MOC process. ŁBe alert to subtle changes that might not be safe.Here™s What Should Happen:Good ideas improve operations and reduce risk every day. However, before implementing a good idea, it is essential to review the change to ensure that it doesn™t introduce any new hazards or risks to the workplace. In this incident, the mechanic should have recognized what he was about to do as ﬁnot like-in-kindﬂ and reviewed the change through the MOC process. This would have identified that the gear box was not designed for pressure.AIChE ©2003. All rights reserved. Reproduction for non-commercial, educational purposes is encouraged.
